However, a ""place"" does not include: a) a road within the meaning of the Transport Operations (Road Use Management Act) 1995. b) a canal associated with residential or commercial development. c) a building or similar structure. d) a dam wall or similar structure. e) a local government area or a division or ward of a local government area. f) an electoral district under the Electoral Act 1992. g) another place prescribed by regulation.","(external, absolute) Coordinates for place names collated from the Place Names Card File system are shown to the nearest minute of latitude and longitude. The upgraded and new records have coordinates recorded to the nearest second of latitude and longitude. For linear features such as watercourses and gullies, the point relates to the mouth or confluence.*",Queensland,138.018,-29.182,153.984,-9.131,16-Jul-07*,Monthly,,Department of Resources,PO Box 937.
