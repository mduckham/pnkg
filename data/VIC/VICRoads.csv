This unit had been raised in a hurry because of a surplus of recruits at the Broadmeadows training camp and a need to clear a few of them out to make more space. The battalion officially came into existence during the first week of May 1915, and the men sailed on HMAT Euripides on the tenth of that month. The men arrived in Egypt sometime in July, and then spent the next two months catching up on the training they had missed at Broadmeadows. Then, on 28 August, they proceeded to Alexandria, boarded a ship and headed for Gallipoli, arriving there on 6 September. Once having disembarked, the men were ordered to move to Courtney's Post, one of the furthest advance points on the heights of Anzac Cove. Life at Courtney's Post had been precarious from the start of the campaign, the Turkish trenches being in very close proximity. The men at the post had already repelled one large attack in May. 24 Battalion was subjected to sniper fire very quickly and the new troops hurriedly learned to duck their heads. Their stay at Courtney's was to be short, however. Two days later, they were ordered to withdraw, occupy White's Valley and hold the garrison position at Lone Pine. The position at Lone Pine had been captured by Australian troops on 6 August. On a day when a number of feints were carried out (including the infamous and murderous one at The Nek) to distract the Turks from British reinforcements landing at Suvla Bay, the capture of Lone Pine stood out as a solitary victory - although at a horrendous cost in life and limb. Naturally, the Turks wanted it back, and carried out regular sniping, bombardments and attacks on the position. When it took over the garrison along with 23 Battalion, 24 Battalion was subjected to sixteen weeks of fighting that the Australian War Memorial tells us was so dangerous and exhausting that the battalions rotated between the valley and the garrison every day. By 29 September, in addition to a significant number of casualties, the battalion diary indicated that 112 men were sick in hospital, suffering from afflictions such as dysentery. typhus and general debilitation. When October began, the remaining troops were still rotating between White's Valley and the garrison. Even in the valley, however, they were not safe. On 10 and 11 October, the diary recorded that shrapnel and shells were continually falling on them. The men returned to the garrison on the twelfth and were subjected to continual bombing and sniping, and an enemy advance on one of their positions that was successfully repulsed. The diary indicated that the enemy fire that day was heavier than usual. The battalion spent most of November at Lone Pine with only a week relief at White's Valley. On 29 November the temperature was freezing, lots of shells falling at Lone Pine resulting in heavy causalities for both the 23rd and 24th battalions - totalling over 100 across all ranks - Charles was one of those killed in action on 29 November.",English,,Yes,10.0,11.0,2017.0,Journal,Cheryl Baulch,Centenary of ANZAC,,,,,,83,,,"Our Soldiers, Men and Women from the Torquay area",July,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.3243303 -38.314101)

The family moved to Coolgardie, Western Australia, when he was 2. Educated at the local state school, he worked as a labourer for the Boulder City Brewery Co. Ltd. On 19 July 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. Five ft 7Â¼ ins (171 cm) tall, with grey eyes, black hair and a dark complexion, he gave his religious denomination as Catholic. He arrived in the Middle East too late to serve at Gallipoli and in March 1916 joined the 16th Battalion at Tel el Kebir, Egypt.

Reaching France in June 1916, the battalion attacked towards Mouquet Farm, near PoziÃ¿Â¨res, on 9 August. Axford was evacuated with shell-shock on the 11th, but he quickly rejoined his unit. A year later, on 10 August 1917, he suffered a shrapnel wound to his left knee at Gapaard Farm, Belgium. After treatment in hospital in England, he returned to his unit in January 1918 and next month was promoted to lance corporal. In March-April the 16th Battalion, as part of the 4th Brigade, stopped the German offensive at HÃ¿Â©buterne, France. Axford was awarded the Military Medal in May.

His most conspicuous hour came on 4 July 1918 at the battle of Hamel. The Allied barrage opened at 3.10 a.m. and when it lifted shortly afterwards the 16th Battalion attacked Vaire Wood. Axford's platoon reached the enemy defences but a neighbouring platoon was held up at the wire. Machine-guns inflicted many casualties among Axford's mates in the other platoon. He dashed to the flank, bombed the machine-gun crews, jumped into the trench and charged with his bayonet. In all, he killed ten enemy soldiers and captured six. Throwing the machine-guns over the parapet, he called the delayed platoon forward and then rejoined his own. In ninety-three minutes the victory of Hamel was complete. Axford's initiative and gallantry won him the Victoria Cross. `I must have been mad', he commented later. On 14 July he was promoted to corporal.

In December 1918 Axford came home to Australia on furlough. Discharged from the army on 6 February 1919, he recommenced work as a labourer. At St Mary's Cathedral, Perth, on 27 November 1926 he married Lily Maud Foster, a shop assistant. They lived at Mount Hawthorn and had five children. Axford was employed by Hugh McKay (Massey Harris) Pty Ltd and became a clerk. On 25 June 1941 he was mobilised in the Militia and posted to the District Records Office, Perth. Rising to sergeant in February 1943, he was discharged on 14 April 1947. In his leisure time `Jack' regularly attended the races.

Axford attended the VC centenary celÃ¿Â­ebrations in London in 1956. He was returning from a reunion of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association when he died on 11 October 1983 on an aircraft between Dubai and Hong Kong. His wife had died three months earlier. Survived by their two sons and three daughters, he was cremated with full military honours. In 1985 his VC and other medals were presented to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.",,,Yes,,,,Website,P L Edgar,,,,2007.0,,,,,,,,,,,Australian Dictionary of Biography,"Axford, Thomas Leslie (Jack) (1894-1983)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/axford-thomas-leslie-jack-12159,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.9011661 -36.1434637)

Educated at Adelaide Technical High School, in 1950 Peter entered the South Australian Public Service as a clerk. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 10 June 1950. Graduating from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, Victoria, on 13 December 1952, he was allocated to the Royal Australian Artillery. Postings to the 14th National Service Training Battalion (1953 and 1955-57) and the 1st Field Regiment (1953-55 and 1957-58) followed. On 26 May 1956 he married 17-year-old Denise Maureen MacMahon in the Methodist Church, Manly, Sydney.
Promoted temporary captain, in December 1958 Badcock was sent to Army Headquarters as a staff officer. In 1961 he changed his surname to Badcoe. While serving in Malaya with the 103rd Field Battery from September 1961 to November 1963, he spent a week (7-14 November 1962) in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). He saw the conditions under which the South resisted communist insurgency which was led by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam). Back in Australia, Badcoe returned to the 1st Field Regiment, but in 1965 transferred to the infantry; in June 1966 he was promoted provisional major. He arrived in Saigon on 6 August to join the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam. Short, round and stocky, with horn-rimmed spectacles, Badcoe did not look a hero. He was a quiet, gentle and retiring man, with a dry sense of humour. His wife was his confidante. Badcoe neither drank alcohol nor smoked; bored by boisterous mess activities, he preferred the company of a book on military history. To his colleagues he was an enigma, yet many humoured his boundless enthusiasm in field exercises and his off-duty discourses on martial matters.
Serving in Thua Thien province, in December 1966 Badcoe became operations adviser at provincial headquarters, Hue. On 23 February 1967, during a small operation in the Phu Thu district, he ran across almost 650 yards (594 m) of fire-swept ground to assist a platoon of the South Vietnamese Popular Forces. Taking charge of the unit, Badcoe led it in a frontal attack, averting defeat and inflicting heavy casualties. He collected the corpse of an American adviser and braved further volleys to rescue one who was wounded. Commanding the province's reaction company on 7 March, Badcoe conducted a series of fierce assaults which put to flight a strong People's Liberation Armed Forces (Viet Cong) formation and saved the district headquarters of Quang Dien and its defenders.
On 7 April 1967 he wrote his last letter to his wife: 'It's time I came home. I'm getting bitter and cynical . . . I can see more and more good about the Vietnamese and less and less about the US advisers'. That day he learned that the 1st Division Reaction Company was in difficulty near the hamlet of An Thuan. Knowing that the company would be denied air support unless advisers were present, he drove there by jeep with a United States Army sergeant. On arrival, Badcoe found that the force had fallen back. He took charge and rallied the men in the face of withering fire. Crawling ahead, he made several attempts to silence a machine-gun with grenades. His sergeant at one stage pulled him out of the line of fire. Rising again to throw another grenade, Badcoe was shot and killed.
For his feats of gallantry and leadership, he won the Victoria Cross and the United States Silver Star; the Republic of Vietnam awarded him its National Order, three Crosses for Gallantry and the Armed Forces Honour Medal. Badcoe had been highly respected by his Vietnamese and American comrades-in-arms. Survived by his wife and three daughters, he was buried in the Terendak military cemetery, Malacca, Malaysia.

Born Jedburgh Scotland, Lived and enlisted in Jan Juc. Named on honour boards at Barrabool & South Barwon Shire.
Originally from Scotland, William, known as Douglas, arrived in Australia in 1909 and after a few years he settled in Jan Juc working as a motor mechanic before turning his hand to farming. He was attached to the 4th Light Horse Brigade, 2nd Reinforcement when he enlisted on 9 December 1914. They embarked from Melbourne on 3 February 1915 aboard the HMAT A13 Katuna and landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula on 27 July 1915 eight weeks after the first 4th LH regiment landed there. The unit was used in various locations to defend the Allies positions on the peninsula, especially the area of 'Ryrie's Post'. Douglas was sent to hospital with haemorrhoids, and evacuated to Malta for recovery on 29 September 1915 then on to London.
After rejoining his unit on 14 February 1916 in Egypt Douglas was transferred to the 1st Cycle Corps on 20 March sailing to France a few days later. A month after arrival he was transferred to the 5th Battalion. During the month of May Douglas was promoted to Lance Corporal then to Corporal. On 31 May 1916 while at Fleurbaix sector, forward trenches Douglas received a gun shot wound to left leg resulting in a compound fracture of the femur. He was evacuated to England where he continued to be stationed for just over a year.
During February - June 1917 he was granted special leave to attend the Imperial College Kensington followed in October by an appointment to 2nd Lieutenant and a posting to the Machine Gun Corps reinforcements; subsequently he headed overseas in December to join the unit.
In January 1918 Douglas was posted to the newly formed 1st Machine Gun Battalion and promoted to Lieutenant. It consolidated the Machine Gun Companies of the three brigades within the Division; the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. MG Companies and Battalions were equipped with the legendary Vickers Medium Machine Gun. This weapon was served by a crew of three and mounted on a tripod. It was not easily portable and was generally sited in a prepared fixed position.
In March of 1918, the German Army was on the move. The Australians were sure that a major enemy attack was brewing-and attack they did. As the Germans poured through gaps in the British and French fronts, some units were simply obliterated. The Allies suddenly faced new German tactics. The enemy advanced in a 'flying wedge' formation, with bombers and machine-gunners up front and specially trained 'storm troopers' deployed to encircle and wipe out their enemy from the flanks. Many of the towns that earlier had been won with Allied blood were now lost to the enemy. When the city of Albert was seized by the German forces, they appeared invincible. The Australian Divisions were rushed to seal the breaches in the lines. The 1st Machine Gun Battalion was located at La Clytte in Belgium just south of Ypres, during March and Vaux to Hazebrouck in April holding the position against the German Sixth Army. During May, in a series of small operations, the 1st Division recovered lost ground from the German offensive. After the withdrawal of the Germans the 1st Machine Gun Battalion maintained position at the towns of Hemelet and Morcourt, northeast of Villers-Bretonneux.
Late November, while riding a horse along a muddy road Douglas fractured his 7th right rib. He spent three weeks in hospital. Once he recovered he was granted a short leave to England, returning to France in early March then sent back to England for return to Australia on 12 May 1919.",English,,Yes,24.0,6.0,2016.0,Journal,Cheryl Baulch,Centenary of ANZAC,,,,,,83,,,"Our Soldiers, Men and Women from the Torquay area",July,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.3259158 -38.3117487)

While still in his teens he migrated with his brother Walter to Australia and was working at Geelong, Victoria, as a labourer when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 8 January 1915.

Beatham embarked for Egypt in April and was returned to Australia on medical grounds in July. He re-embarked in September with reinforcements for the 8th Battalion and six months later moved on to France where he was twice wounded in action-at PoziÃ¿Â¨res in August 1916 and Passchendaele in October 1917. When the great Allied offensive was launched on 8 August 1918, his unit was among those ordered to advance from HarbonniÃ¿Â¨res and capture the high ground of Lihons north of RosiÃ¿Â¨res. On approaching this German strong point on 9 August the 8th Battalion, its supporting tanks knocked out by heavy artillery fire, was halted by a line of machine-guns. Private Beatham's company worked its way forward to enfilade the enemy position and, assisted by Lance Corporal W. G. Nottingham, he rushed forward and bombed the crews of four guns, killing ten men and capturing ten others. This action enabled the battalion to renew its advance. On 11 August when nearing its objective on the southern slope of Lihons it was again halted by German reinforcements. Beatham, though wounded, rushed another machine-gun and bombed and silenced it, but was riddled with bullets. He was buried at Heath cemetery, HarbonniÃ¿Â¨res.

Louisa Annie Bicknell was born in 1879 and grew up on her family&#39;s farm near Elmore in northern Victoria.

She was educated in Kyneton and worked there as a dressmaker and Sunday school teacher before she answered the call to nursing.

She trained as a nurse at the Mooroopna and worked in a range of positions at Creswick Hospital, the Royal Women&#39;s Hospital in Melbourne and the Melbourne District Nursing Society before coming to Bairnsdale around 1907 to work at Sister Kate Massey&#39;s Private Hospital in Bairnsdale. Some accounts suggest she established the hospital.

The young nurse quickly became part of the Bairnsdale community. She was a parishioner at St John the Baptist Anglican Church and was among the first members of the Bairnsdale branch of the Red Cross.

She later went on to run the hospital in partnership with a fellow Mooroopna Hospital trainee, Annie Williams.

But she gave it all up to enlist for service in World War I with the Australian Army Nursing Service on 10 April, 1915 - just two weeks before the ill-fated invasion at Gallipoli.

Seven weeks later, she arrived in Egypt to start work at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Cairo&#39;s Palace Hotel, where she and a dedicated team treated many wounded men from the battlefield at Gallipoli.

Within weeks, she was dead. A scratch on her left hand became infected as she tended to the wounded in the hospital&#39;s surgical ward.

Six days after the infection set in, in the early hours of 25 June 1915, she died from septicaemia (blood poisoning), aged 36.

Louisa Bicknell was buried with full military honours in the Cairo War Memorial Cemetery.

On 30 June 1915, The Bairnsdale Advertiser reported that Rev. AEF Young of St John the Baptist told parishioners at the end of his Sunday service: &#34;It is both strange and sad that she, a non-combatant, and one who so recently left our midst, should be the first resident of the town to give her life for her country; and this she has done as really as if she had fallen on the field of battle.&#34;

Writing home about Louisa&#39;s death, her 1st Australian General Hospital nursing colleague Mabel Pilkington, said she was with Louisa when she died and described her as &#34;one of the brightest, healthiest, and most unselfish nurses I have ever known&#34;.

&#34;She was as brave as any fighting soldier, and said when she was dying, &#39;How hard it is to die with so little accomplished, but I would go through it again to help, and it is all in the game,&#39;&#34; she wrote.

William senior was a founder of the Quarrymen&#39;s Union and an organizer of the Municipal Employees&#39; Union. Educated at St Brigid&#39;s School, North Fitzroy, and St George&#39;s School, Carlton, young Bill became a foundry worker at the Newport railway workshops. At 17 he joined the British Australasian Tobacco Co. Pty Ltd where his duties included tobacco-tasting; for the rest of his life he was an inveterate pipe-smoker. On 16 August 1924 at St Mary&#39;s Catholic Church, West Melbourne, he married a machinist Mary Moodie.

An aggressive debater and prominent member of the Carlton branch of the Australian Labor Party, Barry was secretary of the Tobacco Workers&#39; Union in 1924-31. Having won a surprise pre-selection victory over William Slater, in July 1932 he was returned at a Legislative Assembly by-election for Labor&#39;s blue-ribbon seat of Carlton. &#39;Something of a favourite&#39; of John Wren, Barry led the right-wing faction and was secretary of the parliamentary Labor Party in 1938-55. Minister of transport in the four-day Cain government of September 1943, he held the portfolios of health, housing and forests under Cain in 1945-47 and was again minister of health in Cain&#39;s cabinet in 1952-55.

Bill was a genial man with a flair for publicity, but his use of invective often embarrassed his colleagues: he labelled (Sir) Archie Michaelis a &#39;refo&#39;; he said of (Sir) Wilfrid Kent Hughes that &#39;a few years in the Jap camps did not do him much good&#39;; he accused Melbourne city councillors of &#39;racketeering&#39;; he forced Cecil McVilly to resign as chairman of the Hospitals and Charities Commission and branded him a &#39;Sawdust Caesar&#39;. Barry never lacked ambition. He contested the deputy-leadership after the death of Herbert Cremean in 1945 and hoped to displace Cain as leader. Barry&#39;s wife Mary, &#39;a woman of notably independent and outspoken mind&#39;, served on the central executive of the Victorian branch of the party in 1950-55 and was secretary (1947-55) of the women&#39;s central organizing committee.

The Barrys had little to do with the industrial groups, but were staunch anti-communists. In the split of 1955-an event which Barry tried to avert-both were expelled from the Labor Party. Barry became joint-leader (with Patrick Coleman) of the Anti-Communist Labor Party (later the Democratic Labor Party). When Barry led his breakaway group across the floor in April 1955-in support of the no confidence motion which brought down the Cain government-thirty pieces of silver were thrown at his feet. In the ensuing election the contest for Carlton was &#39;the bitterest and most violent of the campaign&#39;. Barry received dead rats in the mail. Defeated by Labor&#39;s Denis Lovegrove, as a D.L.P. candidate Barry unsuccessfully contested Fitzroy in 1961 and Greensborough in 1967.

A member (1939-55) of the Melbourne City Council, Barry had been its representative on the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (1945-55) and on the Olympic Organising Committee (1952-55); he was also a trustee (1946-55) of the Exhibition Building. Kate White&#39;s biography of John Cain has referred to allegations that Barry was corrupt when minister for housing, but there is no evidence of personal wealth. After losing his seat, he ran a milk bar and later a licensed grocery. In his last years he lived in an East Brunswick hotel owned by his daughter and son-in-law. Survived by his wife, three sons and four daughters, he died on 21 December 1972 at Fitzroy and was buried in Melbourne general cemetery.",,,,,,,Website,Geoff Browne,,,,1993.0,,,,,,,,,,,Australian National University,William Peter (Bill) Barry,Australian Dictionary of Biography,https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/barry-william-peter-bill-9444,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.9770241 -37.7773924)

His grandfather, John Bisdee, had arrived in the colony in 1821. He was educated at The Hutchins School, Hobart, and then worked on his father's property until April 1900 when he enlisted for service in the South African War as a trooper in the 1st Tasmanian Imperial Bushmens' Contingent.

Bisdee sailed on 26 April and served in operations in Cape Colony, the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony. On 1 September, near Warmbad, Transvaal, he was with a scouting party ambushed by Boers in a rocky defile; six of its eight men were wounded, including an officer whose horse broke away and bolted. Bisdee dismounted, put the wounded man on his own horse and ran alongside, then mounted behind him and withdrew under heavy fire. For this action he received the Victoria Cross-the first awarded to a Tasmanian. Wounded during the ambush, he was invalided home but, on recovering, went back to South Africa as a lieutenant in No.1 Company, 2nd Tasmanian Imperial Bushmens' Contingent, and served from March 1901 until the end of the war.

After his return to Tasmania Bisdee resumed farming at Hutton Park. On 11 April 1904, at St John's Anglican Church, Hobart, he married Georgiana Theodosia, daughter of Bishop M. B. Hale. Two years later he joined the 12th Australian Light Horse Regiment, Tasmanian Mounted Infantry, as a temporary lieutenant and was promoted lieutenant in 1908 and captain in 1910; in that year he attended a course of instruction in India. In August 1913 he became commanding officer of his regiment, now the 26th Light Horse.

Bisdee joined the Australian Imperial Force as a captain in the 12th Light Horse on 26 July 1915. Accompanied by his wife, who was to do valuable work in the A.I.F. canteens, he sailed for Egypt in November. He served in operations against the Senussi at Mersa Matruh until a leg wound precluded him from active service; he was seconded as assistant provost marshal, first to A.I.F. Headquarters, Egypt, in March 1916, then two months later to the Anzac Mounted Division. Bisdee was promoted major in September, returned to regimental duty in December and served with the Light Horse throughout 1917. In January 1918 he became assistant provost marshal (Egypt section) of the Anzac Provost Corps; in June he was confirmed as lieutenant-colonel. He was mentioned in dispatches and appointed O.B.E. in June 1919.

Bisdee was discharged from the A.I.F. in May 1920. A major in the Australian Military Forces from 1915, he was placed on the reserve in 1921 and on the retired list, with the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel, in 1929. He had continued to farm at Ashburton, Bridgewater, in Tasmania, the property he had acquired in 1915. While travelling in France in 1926 his wife died. He returned to Tasmania and lived at Tranquility, Melton Mowbray, where he died of chronic nephritis on 14 January 1930; he and his sister (who died next day) were buried in St James's churchyard, Jericho, in the same grave.

Thomas Blackburn and his second wife Margaret Harriette Stewart, nee Browne. He was educated at Pulteney Grammar School, the Collegiate School of St Peter and the University of Adelaide (LL.B., 1913). He had been articled to C. B. Hardy and was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1913. Although not a sturdy youth, Blackburn enlisted as a private in the 10th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, in October next year, and landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. Charles Bean concluded that he and another private that day reached a point further inland than any other Australian soldier achieved in the campaign. Blackburn himself was modest and retiring on the matter in later years. He was commissioned second lieutenant in August and served throughout the Gallipoli campaign and in France in 1916. On 23 July, at Pozieres, he commanded a party of fifty men which, in the face of fierce opposition, destroyed an enemy strong point and captured nearly 366 m of trench, Blackburn personally leading four successive bombing parties, many members of which were killed. For this exploit he was awarded the Victoria Cross 'for most conspicuous bravery'. In September he was evacuated sick and was later invested by King George V at Buckingham Palace.
Invalided to Adelaide, on 22 March 1917 Blackburn married Rose Ada Kelly in his old college chapel, and was shortly afterwards discharged on medical grounds. He returned to legal practice and took an active part in the pro-conscription campaigns. In 1918-21 he was Nationalist member for Sturt in the House of Assembly. His speeches usually related to serving and returned soldiers; an exception was a resolution, passed on his motion, in favour of a system of profit-sharing for employees in industry. He continued his practice but found parliamentary duties a heavy burden and did not seek re-election in 1921. He was a founding member of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League in South Australia and president of the State branch in 1917-21. In 1933-47 he was city coroner, in which office he encountered and ignored criticism for refusing to offer public explanation for any decision not to hold an inquest.
In 1939, having served as a militia officer for fifteen years, Blackburn was promoted lieutenant-colonel and took command of a motorized cavalry regiment. In 1940 he was appointed to command the 2nd/3rd Australian Machine-Gun Battalion, A.I.F., which fought under his command in Syria in 1941. Blackburn, as the senior Allied officer present, accepted the surrender of Damascus on 21 June, and after the campaign was a member of the Allied Control Commission for Syria. In February 1942 a small Australian force including his battalion was hastily landed in Java; he was promoted temporary brigadier and appointed to command 'Black Force', with orders to assist the Dutch against the rapid Japanese advance. After three weeks vigorous but fruitless resistance, and despite Blackburn's reluctance, the Allied forces surrendered: he was a prisoner until September 1945 when he was liberated in Mukden, Manchuria, weakened but not broken in health. In 1946 he was appointed C.B.E. (Military) for distinguished service in Java. After the Second World war he served as a conciliation commissioner in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; was a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission and was a company director. He was the State president of the R.S.L. in 1946-49 and was chairman of trustees of the Services Canteen Trust Fund from 1947 to his death; for these and other community services he was appointed C.M.G. in 1955.

Born in 1884 near Wagga Wagga, he was originally a teacher before receiving a commission in the Commonwealth Cadet Forces in 1906 and being posted to Melbourne. In 1910 he transferred to the Australian Military forces and was promoted to captain. He graduated from the Staff College at Quetta in India in 1913, was in England when the First World War began and joined the general staff of the 1st Australian Division in Egypt. Blamey landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915; in July he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and returned to Egypt to help form the 2nd Australian Division.

On the Western Front, Blamey was appointed Chief of Staff and served as General Staff Officer 1 in the 1st Division until June 1918 when he was promoted to temporary brigadier and became Chief of Staff of the Australian Corps. After the war Blamey received several important postings, including one to London as Colonel, General Staff and Australia's representative on the Imperial General Staff. In 1925, he was appointed Second Chief of the Australian General Staff. Shortly afterwards, however, he left the regular army to become Victoria's commissioner of police and transferred to the militia.

Considered confrontational, violent, and ruthless, Blamey's tenure with the police was dogged by controversy; he was forced to resign in 1936 having lied to protect one of his senior officers. He remarried in April 1939 after the death of his first wife four years earlier. Within a month of the Second World War beginning he was given command of the 6th Division. The following year he became commander of the Australian Corps. Despite a mixed performance early in the war - his fitness for command was questioned by some subordinates - Blamey received further promotions and in December 1941 reached the rank of General.

In March 1942, with Japan having entered the war, Blamey returned to Melbourne as Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces and, under General Douglas MacArthur, became commander of Allied land forces in the Pacific. Overshadowed by the American - MacArthur had the prime minister's ear - and resented by many senior Australian officers, Blamey encountered numerous difficulties. His removal of several senior officers in Papua under pressure from MacArthur remains controversial.

Blamey conducted a series of successful offensives in New Guinea in 1943 but was criticised late in the war when Australians were involved in operations against long-bypassed Japanese units in New Guinea and Borneo. On a personal level, Blamey's public drinking and womanising harmed his reputation. Professionally, his failure to stand up for his subordinates prompted one historian to write that he was ""the foremost Australian General of World War II but he will never be remembered as the greatest.""

His father was a native of Cork, Ireland; his mother was Victorian-born. Educated at the Christian Brothers' school, Abbotsford, he became a coach-trimmer and was working at Warrnambool when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 18 December 1914. Next June he embarked for Egypt with reinforcements for the 13th Light Horse Regiment but by late September 1915 he had returned to Australia and was discharged.

Buckley re-enlisted in Sydney on 16 May 1916 under the name of Gerald Sexton; Gerald was the name of a deceased brother. He left for France in October with 13th Battalion reinforcements and joined his unit on the Somme in January 1917. That year he fought at Bullecourt, Polygon Wood, Ypres and Passchendaele and early in 1918 at HÃ¿Â©buterne and Villers-Bretonneux. He was promoted lance corporal in January and by June was a lance sergeant in charge of a Lewis-gun section. After being wounded at Hamel he resumed duty for the battle of 8 August in which he won the Distinguished Conduct Medal. While advancing from Hamel towards Morcourt his company was delayed by sudden machine-gun fire on four separate occasions; he quickly silenced each enemy post by using his Lewis-gun with great promptness and skill. Once, when the battalion was advancing through tall crops, a hidden gun fired into its ranks causing several casualties. Buckley stood up in full view of the enemy, calmly noted the position of the gun from the flashes and, firing from the hip, put it out of action. He was confirmed as sergeant on 28 August.

On 18 September the 13th Battalion took part in the attack on Le Verguier. Setting off behind the creeping barrage it cleared several enemy outposts, two of which fell to Buckley's Lewis-gun. When a field-gun held up one company he rushed towards it, shot the crew and raced under machine-gun fire across open ground to put a trench-mortar out of action. He then fired into an enemy dug-out and captured thirty Germans. By the end of the day he had rushed at least six machine-gun positions, captured a field-gun and taken nearly 100 prisoners: he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The award was gazetted under the name Sexton, and Buckley then decided to reveal his identity; a second gazettal was made in his real name.

Buckley returned to Australia and was discharged in December 1919; next year he began work as a road-contractor in Gippsland. On 15 January 1921 he was injured when he tried to jump his horse over the railway gates at Boolarra. He died twelve days later in hospital at Fitzroy, and after a requiem mass in St Patrick's Cathedral was buried in Brighton cemetery with full military honours. Ten Victoria Cross winners were pallbearers. Buckley was unmarried.

His father died when Bugden was 6, leaving four children; and his mother remarried. Educated at Gundurimba Public School and the convent school at Tatham, he later worked for his stepfather as a barman at the Federal Hotel, Alstonville; outgoing and popular, he excelled at football, cricket and shot-putting. Before joining the Australian Imperial Force he completed twelve months military training under the compulsory scheme introduced in 1911.

Bugden enlisted in the A.I.F. as a private on 25 May 1916, trained at Enoggera in Queensland, and in September embarked for the Western Front with 31st Battalion reinforcements. He joined the unit on 19 March 1917 at Bapaume and served there until the end of May. On 26 September the battalion took part in the second phase of the battle of Polygon Wood. As it advanced towards its objective the leading platoons were swept by fierce machine-gun fire from a group of pillboxes. Bugden was in a small party sent forward to attack the first strong point: successfully 'silencing the machine-gun with bombs', he 'captured the garrison at the point of the bayonet'. In the next two days he performed several similar acts of gallantry, each of which contributed to the battalion's advance. Once, single-handed, he rescued a corporal who was being taken to the German lines, and at least five times he dashed out into intense shell and machine-gun fire to bring in wounded. 'Always foremost in volunteering for any dangerous mission', he was killed on 28 September. For his bravery during the preceding two days Bugden was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

The family moved to Euroa and, after attending the state school, Burton followed his father into the firm of A. Miller & Co., working in the ironmongery department. He was a chorister in the Euroa Presbyterian Church, a member of the town band, and was active in sport. In 1911 he began his period of compulsory military service.

On 18 August 1914 Burton enlisted in the 7th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, and embarked for Egypt in October. On 4 April 1915 his battalion embarked for Lemnos and on the 25th took part in the landing at Anzac. Burton, who was ill with a throat infection, watched the landing from a hospital ship but a week later he was in the trenches. The 7th Battalion was then fighting near 400 Plateau; on 5 May it left Anzac beach to participate in the attack on Krithia, then returned to serve at Monash Valley and Steele's Post. Burton was slightly wounded in action and in July was promoted lance corporal for having volunteered for and taken part in a dangerous operation; he was later promoted corporal.

Burton was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery in the trenches at Lone Pine on 9 August. Early that morning the Turks launched a strong counter-attack on a newly captured trench held by Burton, a personal friend Lieutenant F. H. Tubb, Corporal W. Dunstan and a few others. The Turks advanced up a sap and blew in the sandbag barricade but Burton, Tubb and Dunstan repulsed them and rebuilt it. Supported by strong bombing parties, the enemy twice more destroyed the barricade but were driven off and the barricade was rebuilt. Burton was killed by a bomb while building up the parapet. Tubb and Dunstan were also awarded the Victoria Cross. Burton's award was gazetted on 15 October and on 28 January 1916 he was mentioned in dispatches.

His kind and manly nature had won him many friends; even before Lone Pine he was frequently mentioned in soldiers' letters for various daring acts. He has no known grave, but his name is commemorated on the Lone Pine Memorial, Gallipoli, and by an oak tree and bridge at Euroa. In 1967 his family presented his V.C. to the Australian War Memorial.

Dr. John Cade was a psychiatrist recognised for discovering the effects of lithium carbonate as a mood stabiliser in the treatment of bipolar disorder, previously diagnosed as manic depression. This research in the 1940s was during an era when the common treatment for mental health was electroconvulsive therapy and lobotomy. Lithium was the first effective medication available to treat a mental illness. In 1985, the American National Institute of Mental Health estimated that Dr. Cade's discovery of the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of manic depression saved the world at least USD$17.5billion in medical costs.

Born in 1919 in Karedella South, son of Vincent Denis Cahill, himself a veteran of WWI. He was unmarried and had enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps on 1 May 1940, before reenlisting in the Army on 24 September 1940. He was sent to the Middle East where he joined the 2nd Casualty Clearing Station in mid-1941, but was transferred to Batavia, Dutch East Indies in February 1942. He was reported missing in March 1942, after the capitulation of the Dutch. He was taken prisoner by the Japanese forces, and confirmed as a POW in Java in 1943. It is unclear where Cahill was interred during the war, however, he left Singapore in 1945 after the end of the war, indicating he may have been moved to Changi prison camp with many other POWs. He arrived in Melbourne on the Circassia in November 1945 and after receiving  medical treatment was discharged in February 1946. He was issued with the 1939/45 Star, the Africa Star, the Pacific Star, the Defence Medal, the War Medal and the Australia Service Medal.

Born Tungamah, enlisted Ballarat. Named on honour boards at Puebla, Barrabool and South Barwon Shire and the Torquay Improvement Association.
Michael, a resident of Elaine via Ballarat, had spent about eight months with Mr. J. Charles becoming very popular before he enlisted. His brother lived in the Torquay area, his parents in Malvern. Michael enlisted on 18 January 1916 at Ballarat attached to the 1st Reinforcements of the 39th Battalion.
Following a brief period of training in Ballarat, the 39th Battalion marched through Melbourne on 15 May as the city farewelled the unit and they subsequently embarked upon HMAT Ascanius on 27 May 1916, bound for the United Kingdom. Sailing via Cape Town, the battalion landed at Plymouth on 18 July 1916, and moved by train to Amesbury, before marching to Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. While undertaking the training here Michael was transferred to the 7th Battalion on 9 September proceeding overseas to France a week later. He caught up with his unit in the field on 29 September. The next day, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force roughly equivalent to two platoons The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing a section of the German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.
In October, the battalion returned to the Gueudecourt, Somme where they spent the winter months training and manning trenches. On 16 December, work in the front trenches pushed ahead through mud 4ft deep in some places. Gueudecourt was heavily shelled at intervals during the day and enemy artillery fire was active.

Migrating alone to Australia in 1912, George took a job as a labourer on a sheep station in the Elsmore district, near Inverell, New South Wales. On 16 December 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and became an original member of the 33rd Battalion, formed in February 1916 as part of the new 3rd Division. In May he embarked for England where the division trained before moving to France in November. Cartwright was wounded in action on 9 June 1917 at Messines, Belgium, but remained on duty. He was one of 271 officers and soldiers from the battalion who were victims of the Germans' concentrated gas-attack at Villers-Bretonneux, France, on 17 April 1918. After being hospitalized, he rejoined his unit in June.

On 31 August 1918 the Australian Corps assaulted the enemy's formidable position at Mont St Quentin, overlooking Peronne. The 33rd Battalion attacked south-west of Bouchavesnes at 5.40 a.m. Lacking adequate artillery support at the outset, the leading troops were stopped by machine-gun fire from a post at the corner of Road Wood. Without hesitation, Private Cartwright stood up and walked towards the gun, firing his rifle from the shoulder: he shot the gunner and two who tried to replace him. Cartwright then threw a bomb at the post and, covered by the explosion, rushed forward, capturing the gun and nine German soldiers. Cheering loudly, the Australians renewed their advance. Cartwright was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 30 September, during the attack on the Hindenburg line, he was wounded in the head and left arm, and evacuated to England. Having received his V.C. from King George V, he returned to Australia and was discharged from the A.I.F. on 16 May 1919.

Cartwright lived in Sydney and worked as a motor mechanic. On 25 June 1921 he married Elsie Broker at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Chatswood; they were to have two children before being divorced. He served in the Militia's 4th-3rd Battalion and was commissioned on 25 February 1932. Mobilised for full-time service on 5 March 1940, he was promoted captain (1942) and performed training and amenities duties in Australia. Cartwright was placed on the Retired List on 11 May 1946. He found employment as an assistant-cashier and married Evelyn Mary Short on 4 September 1948 in the Congregational Church, Pitt Street, Sydney.

In 1956 Cartwright visited London for the V.C. centenary celebrations; he returned there for biennial reunions of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. He was a quiet, unassuming man, 170 cm tall, with black hair and a dark complexion. Survived by his wife, and by the son of his first marriage, he died on 2 February 1978 at Gordon and was cremated.

Wodonga&#39;s Castle Creek Road hasn&#39;t always gone by this name. In fact in years gone by it was once called Rats Castle Road.

Around the traps there have been various stories as to how it was christened with Rats Castle; including theories of bushrangers, rat-kangaroos and even ants!
https://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/04/03/2023880.htm

Moya Draper was a newlywed when she moved to the Castle Creek Road area with her late husband; They were wonderful memories, it goes back to about 1938 when we became engaged and we started to build our home and it took a couple of years. It was just like a little track that used to wind in amongst the trees and everything. People in those days wondered why on earth we were moving up there to live, but it was the most wonderful place to live and bringing up a family, we loved every bit of it.

Before they called it Castle Creek Road it was called Rats Castle Road; there is a couple of different theories on why they thought it was called Rats Castle Road. One theory is they thought there were a lot of rat-kangaroos up there. I&#39;m not actually sure how the Castle came but I have been told there were a lot of ant hills up there, another theory was the further you went up the hill; cause its quite high, the further you were going up into the castle. Other people thought it might have been called Rats Castle because of Ned Kelly (and other bushrangers) roaming through there, but I really feel it would have been before Ned Kelly.

After my husband went into council, remarks about Rats Castle in those days were quite derogative and people got tired of it, so he had it changed to Castle Creek Road because it was known as Castle Creek.",english,,,,,,Oral,,,25.0,3.0,2008.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Radio,Rats Castle Road,,,,,,,POINT (146.8775133 -36.1568618)

He was educated at Lowestoft municipal secondary school and worked as a pupil-teacher in the local council school before migrating to Australia at the age of 19. He reached Melbourne in the autumn of 1912, then travelled through the eastern States and on to New Guinea. According to his father, his interest in nature and geography led to his migration and his journeys after arrival.
When World War I broke out Castleton was in Port Moresby and, on offering his services to the Papuan administration, worked with native troops preparing for coastal defence; he also helped to man the Moresby wireless station. On 11 March 1915 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at Sydney, stating his occupation as prospector. He was posted to the 18th Battalion and sailed for Egypt in June. His unit, which was to serve with the 2nd Brigade until the evacuation, reached Gallipoli on 6 August and on the 22nd took part in the attack on Hill 60. Castleton was promoted corporal on 7 December and temporary sergeant in February 1916. On 8 March, soon after his arrival in France, he was transferred to the 5th Australian Machine-Gun Company and was confirmed in his rank. He served on the Somme with this unit and on the night of 28 July took part in an attack on enemy trenches at Pozieres Heights. The Australian advance was stopped by machine-gun fire and shelling, and for three hours troops lay out in No Man's Land under withering fire. Castleton twice brought back wounded men but, while bringing in a third, was hit in the back and killed instantly. He was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously, and was buried in the Pozieres British cemetery at Ovillers-la-Boiselle, France. He was unmarried.",,,Yes,,,,Website,J. K.

He was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy, aristocratic family. He saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second World War while in the British Army. He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns. In H.H. Asquith's Liberal government he served as President of the Board of Trade, Home Secretary, and First Lord of the Admiralty, championing prison reform and workers social security. During World War I, he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign and resigned from the government to serve in the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front after Gallipoli's failure. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions, then as Secretary of  State for War and Air, and finally for the Colonies, where he oversaw the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British policy in the Middle East. 

Out of office during the 1930s, he took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat from Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of World War II, he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister. He oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against Germany and the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the Bombing of Dresden and his wartime response to the Bengal famine generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an 'iron curtain' of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in 1951, his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the Malayan Emergency, the Mau Mau Uprising, the Korean War and the US backed Iranian coup. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral.

John Cunningham was born on July 27 1917, the son of the company secretary of the Dunlop Rubber Company. At nine, he had a joyride in an Avro 504 biplane, and was immediately captivated by the idea of flying. His ambitions were further stimulated at Whitgift School by its proximity to Croydon airport. He then joined the de Havilland apprenticeship scheme. Cunningham, already a  junior test pilot and an Auxiliary Air Force weekend flier with No 604  Squadron, was called up to full-time service shortly before the outbreak of war in 1939. Equipped with the two-engine Bristol Blenheim, which had to search hopelessly for night raiders, Cunningham and his fellow pilots had little more to help them than training, eyesight and instinct. During the early stages of the Battle of Britain in 1940, Cunningham was relieved to be asked to experiment with a photo-electric bomb, devised to be dropped from above on heavy enemy bomber formations. When this project was abandoned, experimental airborne radar was beginning to become available for trial.

On the night of November 19 1940, Cunningham bagged his first Ju 88. After exchanging his make-do Blenheim for a two-engine Bristol Beaufighter he shot down a Heinkel 111 bomber over the Channel and another over Lyme Bay. As Cunningham's score mounted the story was spread that his success owed much to a hearty consumption of carrots, which were said to sharpen his eyesight; and henceforth he was known as ""Cat's Eyes"". The deception, which was aimed at the enemy, also helped Lord Woolton, the food minister, to get across the value of vegetables, particularly carrots, in the rationed wartime diet.

No allusion was made to the primary reason for Cunningham's success, the introduction of airborne radar and its operators; Jimmy Rawnsley, Cunningham's re-trained air-gunner, was one of the best. In mid-April 1941, Cunningham and Rawnsley destroyed three enemy bombers in one night, and when Cunningham left 604 for a staff appointment, the squadron had shot down twice as many enemy aircraft as any other night fighter unit. Cunningham returned to operations early in 1943, when he received command of No 85, a Mosquito night fighter squadron. After adding several more kills to his score - including four fast FW 190 fighter bombers - Cunningham joined Fighter Command's No 11 Group headquarters as a group captain aged 26, still with a baby face and twinkling blue eyes.  

When the war ended, he opted to return to civil aviation. He took over flight development of the Goblin turbojet engine with de Havilland. He became chief test pilot and worked on the development of various planes. In 1956 President Eisenhower presented him with the Harmon Trophy, the highest American honour for services to aviation, in recognition of his contribution to jet transport. Honour was slower at home; and he was not elevated to the de Havilland Board until 1958 when BOAC put Comet IV on to the London-New York route. 

Cunningham remained chief test pilot after Hawker Siddeley had been merged into British Aerospace, where he was an executive director from 1978 until he retired in 1980. He enjoyed looking after the grounds of his home, not far from the former de Havilland airfield and factory in Hertfordshire, and devoted much time and effort to the nearby museum housing the prototype Mosquito and other historic de Havilland equipment and memorabilia. He also supported fundraising efforts for a variety of organisations. Cunningham was appointed OBE in 1951 and CBE in 1963. He was awarded the DSO in 1941 and Bars in 1942 and 1944; the DFC and Bar in 1941, also the Air Efficiency Award (AE). He also held the Soviet Order of Patriotic War 1st Class and the US Silver Star.

He was born in New South Wales, and educated at Sydney high school. He graduated with an economics degree from Sydney University. His first job was with the New South Wales justice department but, while a student, he had joined the university regiment and in 1939 became a lieutenant in the Citizen Military Forces.
In May 1940, he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was posted to an artillery field regiment which, after training in Australia, Egypt and Palestine, went into action in Syria in 1941. Invalided out of the army, by 1943 Cutler had joined New South Wales's security service, and later that year be came assistant commissioner in the department of repatriation in Canberra.
In 1945 he became Australian high commissioner to New Zealand. He was then appointed high commissioner to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and he was Australian minister to Egypt during the 1956 Suez crisis. After Pakistan (1958-61) he was Australian consul-general in New York (1961-65), and delegate to the United Nations (1962-64). His posting as ambassador to the Netherlands (1965-66), was cut short by his appointment as governor of New South Wales. With a reputation for being fair and impartial, he was spectacularly successful in that job, revered by ex-servicemen and seeming to embody what Australia stood for.
He retired in 1981. A big man, in every sense, Cutler had humour, and innate modesty and courtesy. After his retirement, he frequently spoke out, and even if his views were not always popular, they were listened to with respect and affection.
He was appointed CBE in 1957 and KCMG in 1965. He was made a companion of the Order of Australia in 1980 and advanced to knight of the order in 1981. Cutler never wavered in his belief in the monarchy and its relevance to Australia. A frequent visitor to Britain, he was vice-president (overseas), of the VC and GC Association (1986-91), and its deputy president from 1991.
Sir Roden died in February 2002, at the age of 85. He received a state funeral in NSW. Cutler's first wife, Helen, whom he married in 1946, died in 1990. He is survived by his second wife, Joan, and by four sons of his first marriage.

Thomas and Margaret ran a farm in Toombullup on 680 acres, between the years of 1892-1898. In the bush fires of 1898, Thomas and Margaret lost their dwelling and all their movable possessions, the family barely escaping with their lives. Tragically in that same year, Thomas Daly died, leaving Margaret a widow with eight children to care for - the youngest being only twelve months old. Thomas is buried at Shepparton Cemetery. 

After Thomas died, Margaret moved closer to Tatong and leased 20 acres of land. Margaret lived in the area for the rest of her life. She died at the age of 79 in 1937 and is buried at Moorngag Cemetery. 

Thomas and Margaret Daly&#39;s three sons all served in the AIF in World War One. Widowed at young age, Margaret next had to face the stress of having her three sons fighting overseas and so far away. 

All her sons acquitted themselves well in the war, but did not get through it unscathed, as only two of the three came home. 

Francis Martin Daly enlisted with the first AIF on 20 August 1914 at the age of 26. At that time, was living in Tatong and working as a wood machinist. He served overseas and on the 3rd of August 1915 he was awarded the Military Cross. This warrant officer saw seven months service on Gallipoli. He displayed great courage on several occasions, especially on 3 August 1915 during Leans Trench attack On this date he did splendid work in getting ammunition to the firing line. The ammunition magazine was situated in the valley behind Ryrie&#39;s post. This valley was being continuously raked with shell fire but he never hesitated and went to and from the magazine of S.A.A. across the valley and up the communication trench to the forward works although every time he left cover to cross the valley he was facing almost certain death. He received his discharge on the 24 April 1919. 

Thomas James Daly joined up on the 1 May 1916, when he was only 18 years old. At that time he was living in Toombullup and working as a labourer. He was wounded on 1 October 1917 and again on 13 May 1918 where he suffered a severe gunshot wound to the neck. He was treated in the Bath War Hospital England, finally recovering enough to return home in 1919. 
Robert William Daly was born 1895 in Toombullup, he was employed by the Victorian Railways. He enlisted on the 31 August 1916. On 11 April 1918 he was promoted to Corporal. Robert was fatally wounded in action on 25 April 1918 and died the same day in a field hospital in France. He is buried in the Vignacourt British Cemetery and is &#39;Remembered with Honour.&#39; 

One of Thomas and Margaret&#39;s daughters, Margaret Mary born 1888, married Francis McCauley in 1910 in Benalla.

He was educated in Melbourne and became an actor. On 15 April 1907, at Queen Street, Melbourne, he married Elizabeth Edith Smyth with Presbyterian forms; they settled at Fitzroy.

Dartnell was in South Africa when World War I broke out. He went on to England and on 12 February 1915, using the name Wilbur Taylor Dartnell, joined the 25th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (Frontiersmen), as a temporary lieutenant. As the regimental history notes, this battalion 'included men of various ages and with strange experience from all quarters of the globe'. Raised especially for use against German troops in British East Africa, it was the only British unit sent on active service during the war without preliminary training. The Fusiliers reached Mombasa on 4 May and went at once to their military post on the Uganda railway: their main task was to protect the railway from enemy raiding parties. In June the Fusiliers captured Bukoba, the German base for attacks on the Uganda frontier.

In August the battalion had its headquarters at Voi and two of its companies were stationed at Maktau to patrol the frontier. Dartnell, whose rank had been confirmed on 25 July, was assigned on 1 September to a mounted infantry patrol and two days later, near Maktau, his party was ambushed. In the fighting that followed he was wounded in the leg and was being carried away when he realized that the badly wounded could not be removed. 'Knowing that the enemy's black troops murdered the wounded' he 'insisted on being left behind in the hopes of being able to save the lives of the other wounded men'. Though he was twice asked to leave he ordered his men to abandon him and began firing on the Germans who were within twenty-five yards of his post. When his body was found seven enemy dead lay around it. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for giving his own life in a 'gallant attempt to save others'.

Dartnell was buried in Voi cemetery, East Africa. He was survived by his wife and a daughter.

Educated at Flinders Street Model School and Goodwood Public School, he worked as a horse-driver at the time of his enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force at Morphettville on 22 December 1914.

Davey embarked on 2 February 1915 at Melbourne with the 10th Battalion's 2nd reinforcement and proceeded to Egypt and Lemnos prior to the attack on Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. He was present at the landing and took part in four days of heavy fighting which followed. He was engaged in the subsequent trench fighting until eventually invalided from the peninsula with enteric fever. After treatment at the 1st Australian General Hospital at Heliopolis, Egypt, he returned to Australia in January 1916. On 27 June Davey re-embarked with the 10th Battalion's 18th reinforcements and proceeded to England. He joined his battalion in France in September just before it moved into the line at Hill 60 in the Ypres sector. He was accidentally wounded on 15 March 1917 and was gassed on 3 October.

At Warneton, Belgium, in the Messines sector on 3 January 1918, Davey gained the Military Medal for crawling into no man's land under heavy fire to rescue a badly wounded comrade. His brother Claude, serving in the same battalion, had received the same award the previous year, only three months before he was killed in action at Bullecourt in 1917. Another brother, Richard, was also awarded it.

Davey was promoted corporal on 24 April 1918. He took part in an attack on enemy positions at Merris, France, on 28 June. His platoon came under heavy fire and the commander was killed. Survivors were forced to shelter in a ditch under almost point-blank fire from a German machine-gun. Davey then made a single-handed attack on the enemy post until forced to return to his own position for more hand-grenades; attacking again, he killed the crew and captured the gun. He then mounted the machine-gun in a new post and efficiently used it during a counter-attack until he was wounded. For his bravery and determination in this action he was awarded the Victoria Cross. Davey's wounds were severe and he was invalided to hospital at Weymouth, England. On 19 October he embarked for return to Australia where he was discharged from the A.I.F. on 24 February next year.

After the war Davey had three separate periods of employment as a labourer and linesman with the South Australian Railways: from 27 April 1926 to 4 October 1938; from 6 March 1939 to 12 February 1942; and from 17 December 1943 to 22 February 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928, they had no children.

It was in the 2nd battle that Trooper Davies received a gun shot wound to his right arm. He said in an interview years later; 'I replaced a mate who had been killed and shortly after I was hit'. Throughout the remainder of 1917 he was in and out of field hospitals as his wound became septic. In September 1917 he went to the Imperial School of Instruction and qualified as a 1st Class Gunner on the Hotchkiss Machine Gun.

Grenda Bus Company operated from 1945 - 2012, in a nearby site and contributed enormously to the city through the provision of public transport and employment.
The name has strong links and relevance to Dandenong&#39;s history which has been well documented through publications including Taking You Places - Grenda Corporation 2009 and a local art project entitled Depot in 2008 which achieved wide acclaim when it was filmed by the ABC Sunday Arts Program.
Grenda&#39; was a third generation Australian family business, started by George Grenda in 1945, which grew from humble beginnings in a depot at 9 Foster Street Dandenong to become a major player in the Australian Bus Industry. 
George Grenda gradually expanded his business, buying out rival companies and adding to the land and buildings in Foster Street. As Dandenong grew Grenda grew and in the 1940s and 1950s played an important role in transporting workers to and from local industries GMH, Heinz and International Harvester. In 1960 the Foster Street site was expanded and a year later in 1961 George Grenda died leaving sons Lance and Ken to take over.
In 1967 Ken Grenda traveled to Europe on a fact finding mission which resulted in Grenda&#39;s being the first to import Mercedes-Benz coaches to Australia. Grenda also imported the first Volvo and Scania coach chassis into the country.
Later Grenda&#39;s expanded and acquired Blue Line coaches in Sydney and organized a national coach operation (AAT) at the request of TAA (Australia&#39;s national domestic airline before Qantas) and Mayne Nickless Ltd.
Volgren was developed to enable Grenda to become a franchise dealer for Volvo bus chassis for Victoria and the Riverina. Volvo granted Volgren the right to build extruded aluminum bodies thus revolutionising the Australian bus building industry and expanding operations at Volgren&#39;s Hammond Road site in Dandenong South.
Geoff Grenda joined the company in 1983, followed later in the 1980&#39;s by his brother Scott. Ken&#39;s brother Lance retired from the business in 1993.
In 2008 Grenda&#39;s moved from its historic depot site at 9 Foster Street and consolidated its Thomas Street office into a new purpose built, state of the art complex in Cheltenham Road.
In 2012 the sale of Grenda&#39;s to Ventura Bus Lines marked the end of the Grenda family&#39;s 66 year sole involvement in the transport industry.

Tom walked, often barefooted, to two primary schools in succession. He left school at 14. By then he was a bit of a larrikin around the Port, venturesome and quick-witted, keen on boxing, Australian Rules football, cricket and gambling. During the Depression his cheeriness found him odd jobs, fixing bikes, selling newspapers and working for a local baker. Early in 1931 he and some mates rode their bikes about 225 km to Berri, on the Murray River, chasing work. 'Diver', as he was now nicknamed, did long spells in the local 'susso' camp, once living on grapes for a week, but in late 1931 talked his way into work on a vineyard at Winkie. He stayed nine years.
In the presbytery of St Laurence's Catholic Church, North Adelaide, in June 1939 Derrick married Clarance Violet ('Beryl') Leslie. He did not volunteer for the Australian Imperial Force until 26 June 1940 and enlisted on 5 July. He became a convert to Catholicism (his wife's religion) in early 1945. 
On 17 November 1940 Derrick had embarked for the Middle East with the 2nd/48th Battalion, which was to be the most decorated unit in the A.I.F. At Tobruk, Libya his enthusiasm and aggression in patrolling enemy positions brought him promotion to corporal, and he was probably recommended for a Military Medal on 1 May 1941. 
At Tel el Eisa, Egypt, on 10-11 July 1942 Derrick ran forward through a barrage of grenades, destroyed three machine-gun posts and captured over a hundred prisoners. He then inspired the defence against a counter-attack, wrecking two tanks with sticky grenades. Awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, he was promoted sergeant on 28 July. At El Alamein in late October he showed his customary leadership and daring during a week of violent battle. Only forty-one of his battalion still stood at the end of that week, and he had been slightly wounded, but he destroyed three more machine-gun posts.
The 2nd/48th returned to Australia in February 1943 and trained in North Queensland and Papua before helping to capture Lae, New Guinea, in September. By 24 November 1943 the battalion was attacking the heights of Sattelberg, overlooking Finschhafen. Late that afternoon, while leading the advance platoon, he confronted an almost vertical slope of thick jungle hiding Japanese machine-guns, and above that an open patch stretching menacingly 100 yards (91 m) towards the crest. He was told to withdraw, but he decided to go on. Covered by his mates, he scrambled hands and feet up the cliff, hurling grenades into enemy posts and clearing them out with his rifle. He cleared ten machine-gun posts, stopping just short of the crest as dusk fell. He was awarded the V.C. in 1944. 
In February 1944 the 2nd/48th again returned to Australia, and in August he was posted to an officer-training unit. On being commissioned lieutenant in November, he became one of the few second A.I.F. men promoted from the ranks who rejoined their old battalions. On 1 May 1945 the 2nd/48th took part in the landing at Tarakan, Borneo, and soon pushed inland. On the 22nd/23rd Derrick led his platoon against a small hill,, thick with enemy defences. His skill and courage that day might easily have won him another V.C., but by night the enemy still held the highest knoll. He spread out his men, then lay down on the jungle track to rest. At about 3 o'clock next morning a Japanese light machine-gun fired a burst down the track. He sat up to see that his men were O.K., the gun fired again, and five bullets caught him in an arc from his left hip to his right chest. He lay back quietly, and, after a time, said to a mate, 'I've had it. That's that. Write to Beryl'. He continued to direct operations until mid-morning. He died on 24 May 1945 and was buried in Labuan war cemetery.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Bill Gammage,,,,1993.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Derrick, Thomas Currie (Tom) (1914-1945)","Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/derrick-thomas-currie-tom-9958,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.9004723 -36.1415782)

In 1980, as Flinders Shire President, Mrs. Houghton was instrumental in the State Government&#39;s purchase of land along the Sorrento foreshore including Sullivan Bay, the Eastern and Western Sisters and part of Camerons Bight.
This was the site of the 1803 settlement led by Lieutenant-Governor Collins and is historically significant as the site of the British Government&#39;s first official settlement in southern Australia. Lieutenant-Governor Collins led the colonising party of 467 persons despatched from England. The majority of the party consisted of convicts, but also on board were military personnel, administrative staff and a few free settlers. In 1804, Collins decided to move the settlement to Van Diemen&#39;s Land where John Bowen had established a settlement at Risdon Cove in 1803.
Mrs. Houghton lobbied the then Victorian Premier Lindsay Thompson, who gave a guarantee that the government would match any public funds raised to retain the land for public use. Funds were raised through the National Trust and in 1983, Mrs. Houghton was the appointed convenor of the First Settlement Advisory Group, a position she held until 2001.
Mrs. Houghton also worked on many other community groups and committees including:
- National Trust;
- Red Cross;
- McCrae Homestead Committee;
- Rosebud Hospital (Life Member of Rosebud and Royal Children&#39;s Hospitals);
- Peninsula Health;
- Rye Historical Society;
- Nepean Historical Society (Vice President); and

When WWI broke out, at almost 22 years of age, he enlisted in October 1915, declaring his occupation as a Professional Soldier, and claiming two years prior service in a Field Troop and almost four years experience in the Royal Australian Engineers. 
He was initially posted to the 7th Field Company Engineers, but by mid 1917 while in England, Second Lieutenant Arthur Thomas Drinkwater was appointed a Flying Officer in the Royal Flying Corps. 
Known as a WWI flying ace, he attained the rank of captain and was credited with nine aerial victories, six of which were scored as a bomber pilot. He was Group Captain to Charles Kingsford-Smith for a time, and in mid 1919 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross shortly before returning to Australia. 
Although he was partially crippled and used crutches after being badly injured during several crash landings, in the early 1920&#39;s he took up land as a Soldier Settler near Annuello. He married Emma Louise Brown in 1925, and with his knowledge of mechanics and his wife&#39;s farming experience, he became a Mallee success story. 
As was the case for many other soldier settlers in the area, life was tough, and for some years Arthur and Emma lived in an Army tent while they cleared the land with a roller hauled by eight horses. Several years of poor crops, then drought and the recession made things extremely tough, and many settlers walked off their land. 
Arthur was the Honorary Secretary of the Green Mallee Council, a group of Settlers who tried to get the Closer Settlement Board to understand their plight and to give them a better deal. 
Mr. Drinkwater became involved with the local community and was one of the people behind the move to build the Annuello Hall, which housed the town&#39;s first school, Church Services, meetings and gatherings of many various local organisations, dances etc. He regularly drew hearty applause for his singing at events he attended. 
He was also a member of the Annuello School Committee, and in the mid 1940&#39;s he campaigned for the consolidation of several small schools in the area into one at Manangatang, believing the children of the area would receive a far better education at a larger school. 
Mr &amp; Mrs Drinkwater left the area in the mid 1950&#39;s and moved to Myers Flat. During their time in the Annuello district they had increased their landholdings from the original 845 acres to 3300 acres. 
Mr. Drinkwater died in 1972 in Queensland.

However, as the street was named prior to 1861 and as around this time other Dennington streets were named for Crimean War heros, it could possibly have been named for Admiral Sir James Robert Drummond (1812-1895) who was a Royal Navy officer who commanded several ships in the Black Sea during the Crimean War.

He was born in Wangaratta, Victoria in 1907, and studied pharmacy and medicine at the University of Melbourne. He played rugby union for Australia in 1932. His nickname, 'Weary', was a play on the well-known brand of Dunlop Tyres which, according to their makers, 'never near out'. 

He enlisted in the Australian Army Medical Corps in November 1939, and served with the 2nd Australian Imperial Force in Greece, Crete and North Africa. When Australian troops landed in Java in February 1942, Dunlop took command of No. 1 Allied General Hospital at Bandung. When Java fell t the Japanese, he became a prisoner. In January 1943, Dunlop and nearly 900 prisoners prisoners were transferred from Java to Changi. Two weeks later they left for Thailand. 'Dunlop Force' reached Konyu River Camp on 25 January 1943. Dunlop himself moved to Hintok Mountain camp in March, staying there till October, when he was sent to Tha Sao Hospital further down the Kwae Noi. In 1944 he moved to the hospital camp at Chungkai and later to Nakhon Pathom where he remained until the end of the war. 

Dunlop was renowned for his untiring efforts to care for the sick. Many times he put his own health at risk, earning himself physical punishment when he protested to the Japanese. His nearly two metre height seemed to intimidate his captors. Dunlop was also a strong administrator and leader. He kept meticulous notes on the men under his command and his leadership and courage earned him the lasting loyalty of the men who served under him. After the war he was an advocate for former POWs, supporting individuals making pension claims, lobbying governments and taking leadership roles in ex-POW associations. He was knighted in 1969 and received many other honours in his later life. 

He renounced the hatred for the Japanese that had consumed him during the war, and promoted engagement with Asia. In the 1980s, he was one of the group of ex-POWs who helped reclaim Hellfire Pass from the jungle. He died in 1993, and was given a state funderal at St. Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Portions of his ashes were interred at Hellfire Pass and floated down the Kwae Noi in 1994. He has a memorial park in Thailand, and statutes in Canberra, Melbourne, Benalla, and Ballarat.

Born Hindmarsh SA, attended Bellbrae State School, enlisted Geelong. Named on honour boards at Bellbrae and Freshwater Creek.
James was born in Hindmarsh South Australia, attended Jan Juc State School and in 1912 was a grocer in Geelong. James was very involved in the community through his activities as a football umpire in the Geelong & District League and Secretary of the Fox Terrier Club. He married Mabel May Lockwood in 1913 and their daughter Linda May was born the following year. He was still working as a grocer in Geelong when he enlisted in the AIF at Adelaide on 17 December 1915, though, his attestation papers state his occupation as a clerk. He was deployed to Signal School with the 10/27th Infantry Battalion embarking for overseas from Adelaide on 12 August 1916 aboard HMAT Ballarat. They arrived at Plymouth on 30
September 1916 and marched into Rollestone the same day. He was stationed there for nine months before proceeding overseas to France on 14 June 1917 to join the 50th Battalion in the battle of Polygon Wood on 26 September. The battalion saw out the rest of the year alternating between front-line duty, and training and labouring behind the line.
Utilising troops freed by the collapse of Russia in October 1917, the German Army launched a major offensive on the Western Front at the end of March 1918. The 4th Division was deployed to defend positions south of the River Ancre in France. James hurt his back on 24 March 1918 and was invalided back to England. Once recovered in July he was transferred to the overseas training brigade at Hurdcott. In January 1919 he was reassigned to the Australian Army Postal Corps in London where he served until he was transferred back to the 50th Battalion prior to returning home on 1 January 1920.
James returned to Geelong from Adelaide after the war resuming work as a grocer for a short time. The family soon moved to South Australia where James died in 1939 at Riverton after taking his own life. Aged 54 he was a line foreman in the Postmaster-General's Department at Riverton.

Born on 28 November 1899 in North Sydney, he enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy on 31 December 1912 as part of the first intake to the Royal Australian Naval College. In 1917 he was appointed midshipman and was sent to Britain for training with the Royal Navy. He graduated from the Royal Navy Staff College in 1924, and was promoted to commander in 1932. In 1933 he joined HMAS Australia as executive officer. He was attached to the Admiralty's Naval Intelligence Division in 1935. He was promoted captain commanding HMAS Yarra in 1937, Commander of HMAS Perth in 1939, and Commander of HMAS Australia in 1941. 

From 1942, he fought in the War in the Pacific at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the landings at Cape Gloucester, New Britain. In 1944 he was posted to the UK to take command of the HMS Attacker, which participated in the landings in southern France and the liberation of the Aegean. In October 1944 Farncomb flew from the Mediterranean to Manus Island and, on 9 December, assumed command of the Australian Squadron as Commodore First Class. The invasion of Luzon, Philippines, was imminent. HMA Ships Australia, Shropshire, Warramunga (I) and Arunta (I) - under Farncomb in Australia - were to be part of Vice Admiral JB Oldendorf's Bombardment and Fire Support Group of the US Seventh Fleet. Off Luzon and in the Lingayen Gulf, between 5 and 9 January 1945 Australia was successively hit by five kamikaze aircraft. Casualties and damage were severe, but the ship completed her scheduled firings before withdrawing for repairs. Oldendorf described her performance as inspirational. Although Farncomb was wounded, he remained on duty. For his service in the Philippines he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and also awarded the US Navy Cross. On 22 January he hoisted his broad pendant in Shropshire and next month witnessed the bombardment and occupation of Corregidor Island. In May, June and July the Australian Squadron supported landings at Wewak, New Guinea, and at Labuan Island and Balikpapan, Borneo. Farncomb was relieved by Collins on 22 July in Manila and flew to Sydney. Following a short period (August to September 1945) as flag officer-in-charge, New South Wales, Farncomb became Commodore Superintendent of Training at Flinders Naval Depot, Westernport, Victoria. Next year he was appointed a Commander of the US Legion of Merit for his services with the Seventh Fleet in 1944-45. He went back to sea in November 1946, initially as Commodore Commanding, then as Flag Officer Commanding HMA Squadron (Fleet). On 8 January 1947 he was promoted Rear Admiral. He ensured that the fleet met its commitments in the post war period which saw reductions in personnel and ships. He relinquished command of the fleet in late 1949 and was appointed as the Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff, and Naval Attache, at the Australian Embassy in Washington, DC.

Farncomb was transferred to the Retired List of Officers on 7 April 1951. He learned Latin to enable him to study for the Barristers' Admission Board examinations. Admitted to the Bar on 6 June 1958, he developed a reasonably busy practice in Sydney and subsequently joined the solicitors, Alfred Rofe & Sons. As a lawyer, he showed the same penetrating and analytical mind and the industry and ability which had characterised his years in the navy. Heart disease eventually led to his retirement. Survived by his wife, Farncomb died on 12 February 1971 in St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, and was cremated with Anglican rites; his ashes were scattered at sea from his last flagship, HMAS Sydney (III) on March 22. A Collins class submarine was laster named after him, and launched in Adelaide by his widow, Jean Farncombe on 15 December 1995.

Educated at Crows Nest State School and Toowoomba Technical College, Jack entered his father's barber-and-tobacconist business. On 22 October 1939 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was posted to the 2nd/9th Battalion, then being formed at Redbank. Quiet, unassuming and of a serious disposition, French was a 'big fair chap', a good sportsman and well liked. He gave his religion as Presbyterian.

Sailing from Sydney in May 1940, he spent five months in Britain before reaching the Middle East in December. In March 1941 the 2nd/9th assaulted the Italian stronghold at Giarabub, Libya. From April to August the battalion took part in the defence of Tobruk before moving to Syria where it performed garrison duties. French became an excellent soldier. He was promoted acting corporal in December and his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel C. J. Cummings, saw him as a future officer. The 2nd/9th returned to Australia in early 1942 and left again in August, bound for Papua. By mid-month the unit was established at Milne Bay.

On 26 August 1942 a Japanese invasion force landed on the north shore of Milne Bay, east of K.B. Mission. The 2nd/9th moved into the K.B. area on 2 September and on the following day continued east along the coast towards the Goroni River. French was in 'B' Company which crossed the river on 4 September to attack Japanese positions from the rear. A fierce engagement ensued. Three enemy machine-gun posts retarded the section's advance. Ordering his men to take cover, French made his way forward and destroyed one of the posts with grenades; he returned for more grenades and used them to demolish the second strong-point; armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, he attacked the third gun-pit, firing from the hip as he went. Although he was badly wounded, he kept going, silenced the post and died in front of it. His action saved casualties among his comrades and assured the success of the attack. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

French was buried in Port Moresby (Bomana) war cemetery. His grieving fiancÃ¿Â©e Dulcie McCahon said that she 'knew he would always carry out his duty regardless of his safety'. Jack's elder brother Eric served in the A.I.F. On 11 August 1943, while flying with the Royal Australian Air Force, their younger brother Gordon was killed in action over Europe.

Little is known of his early years other than that he was educated at Scottsdale and worked on the family farm after leaving school. He then spent some time in southern Tasmania. While working on his father's farm he had joined the militia and served for three years with the 12th Infantry Battalion (Launceston Regiment). Two elder brothers had seen active service in the South African War.

Before the outbreak of World War I Gaby followed one of his brothers to Western Australia where he worked as a labourer at Katanning. On 6 January 1916, after having been twice rejected for active service, he enlisted the Australian Imperial Force as a private, and after training at Blackboy Hill camp was posted to the 10th reinforcements of the 28th Battalion. He sailed on the troopship Ulysses in April and joined his battalion in France on 6 August. His previous military experience brought him rapid promotion: from lance corporal on 13 August through all the ranks to sergeant on 30 December. On 7 April 1917 he was commissioned second lieutenant; he was promoted lieutenant on 26 September and was wounded in action (gassed) on 29 October.

Gaby was acting as commander of 'D' Company when, as part of the 2nd Division, his battalion was engaged in the great allied offensive of 8 August 1918. The 28th Battalion attacked German positions east of Villers-Bretonneux and in the course of this action Gaby showed conspicuous bravery and dash in leading and reorganizing his company when it was held up by barbed wire entanglements. He found a gap in the wire, and single-handed, approached an enemy strong point in the face of machine-gun and rifle fire. 'Running along the parapet, still alone, and at point-blank range, he emptied his revolver into the garrison', driving the crews from their guns and capturing fifty men and four machine-guns. He then reorganized his men and captured his objective. On 11 August 1918 in another attack near Lihons, during which he again showed bravery and coolness in engaging an enemy machine-gun position, he was killed by sniper fire.

In recording his death the war diary of the 28th Battalion paid special tribute to this gallant officer. He was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously and was buried in Heath cemetery, HarbonniÃ¿Â¨res. Lieutenant Gaby was unmarried.",,,Yes,,,,Website,D.

A boat's crew under the mate Archibald McMillan, in pursuit of a whale,  discovered and surveyed Warrnambool Bay in August 1844. Following this, Captain Gay and others sent a memorial to Superintendent Charles La Trobe drawing his attention to the need to develop the harbour.

Thomas Gay was born in 1808 in Crail, Fifeshire, Scotland. His first wife was Mary Ellen Richardson and they had 1 son, James Gay. 
On his whaling voyages he regularly visited Pigeon Bay, located on the north coast of Banks Peninsula on New Zealand's south island. It was there that he married his second wife, Jane Sinclair, in 1848 whose family farmed at Pigeon Bay. Thomas Gay and his family lived at Pigeon Bay. In 1863 the extended Sinclair family relocated, first to Canada but then to Honolulu where they bought the 180 sq. km island of Niihau. Sinclair descendants still own the island. Thomas Gay continued to trade between Honolulu and New Zealand and Australia. It was while in port at Newcastle, New South Wales, that Thomas Gay died of pneumonia in 1865.

Note that a number of books erroneously call him James Gay.

He was to have enduring memorials in the names of an important road and a suburb. With his wife Elizabeth and her sister, Miss Atherton, Ferrie arrived at Port Phillip on 18 September 1839 as a cabin passenger on the 'Caledonia' which had sailed from Leith in Scotland. Before the end of the year he had purchased land in Swanston and Bourke Streets in Melbourne and commenced practice as a conveyancer and solicitor. He also acquired fi ve acres in Fitzroy which he divided into 80 lots for residential purposes and named two streets for himself and his wife - Ferrie and Atherton. In May and June 1840 Ferrie mortgaged some town land to obtain funds for the purchase and improvement of Portion 21 on the north east corner of the present Glenferrie and Toorak Roads. The cost for the 60 acres of land was 540 pounds.
In 1839 James McAlpine had obtained a pasturage license for
land on Kooyong Koot Creek (now Gardiners Creek) which
including the land Ferrie was to buy. McAlpine neglected to
renew the license on 1 July 1840 and it was taken up by Ferrie so
he would have the use of the land around portion 21. Upon the
land McAlpine had a large planting of potatoes, some milk cows
and a stockyard .The Commissioner of Crown Lands gave him
permission to remove the crops at a later date. Before he could do
so, however, Ferrie's servants destroyed the plants, pulled down
the stockyard and let the cows stray into the bush. McAlpine took
action against Ferrie for 400 pounds damages and when the case
came before Judge Willis on 12 January 1842, the jury with John
Pascoe Fawkner as foreman, awarded McAlpine 141 pounds 15
shillings for the loss of the potatoes, said to be about 12 tons. On 15 January 1841 Ferrie obtained a loan of 1000 pounds secured by a mortgage of portion 21 'known by the name Glenferrie together with the farmhouse and other buildings thereon'. When a census was taken in March 1841 Ferrie's household's return confi rmed that he was occupying the land and had named it Glen Ferrie. The Port Phillip Directory for 1841 gave his address as Glen Ferrie Yarra Yarra. There were 18 residents, Glenferrie c1850 Reg No. 8055
This original artwork is thought to have been painted in the 1840s to 1850s, when Glenferrie was owned by the Damyon family. This is one of two paintings that were in the possession of the family in Argentina. Descendants recently forwarded copies of both to the Archives. 16 of whom had arrived free, one born in the Colony and one Ticket of Leave. His nearest neighbour was John Gardiner who
had squatted on land north of Kooyong Koot Creek in 1836. In 1842 Ferrie sold some town land and began selling lots in Fitzroy but by 1843 he was in fi nancial trouble and was unable to meet his commitments under the mortgage of Glen Ferrie and lost it. Other creditors were pressing him and on 13 March 1843 he assigned 37 lots in Fitzroy to a trustee for the benefit of his creditors. His later movements are obscure until 30 August 1854 when, living at South Yarra, he took action against the trustee alleging fraudulent disposal of some of the trust property. Some further sales of his land were recorded in 1855 and the last one took place on 13 April 1858, the conveyance of which was signed by an attorney on behalf of Ferrie.
In 1857 Glenferrie Road was named Barkly Road after the Governor, Sir Henry Barkly. In 1872 the road was re-named Glenferrie Road. The two streets in Fitzroy named for the Ferries disappeared when the area was re-developed by the Housing Commission.",,,,,,,Newspaper,Malvern Historical Society,Who's Who in Stonnington - Peter Ferrie,,9.0,2006.0,,,3,,,,2,,MHS - Local History News,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (145.0279834 -37.8645526)

He was to have enduring memorials in the names of an important road and a suburb. With his wife Elizabeth and her sister, Miss Atherton, Ferrie arrived at Port Phillip on 18 September 1839 as a cabin passenger on the 'Caledonia' which had sailed from Leith in Scotland. Before the end of the year he had purchased land in Swanston and Bourke Streets in Melbourne and commenced practice as a conveyancer and solicitor. He also acquired five acres in Fitzroy which he divided into 80 lots for residential purposes and named two streets for himself and his wife - Ferrie and Atherton. In May and June 1840 Ferrie mortgaged some town land to obtain funds for the purchase and improvement of Portion 21 on the north east corner of the present Glenferrie and Toorak Roads. The cost for the 60 acres of land was 540 pounds.
In 1839 James McAlpine had obtained a pasturage license for land on Kooyong Koot Creek (now Gardiners Creek) which including the land Ferrie was to buy. McAlpine neglected to
renew the license on 1 July 1840 and it was taken up by Ferrie so
he would have the use of the land around portion 21. Upon the
land McAlpine had a large planting of potatoes, some milk cows
and a stockyard .The Commissioner of Crown Lands gave him
permission to remove the crops at a later date. Before he could do
so, however, Ferrie's servants destroyed the plants, pulled down
the stockyard and let the cows stray into the bush. McAlpine took
action against Ferrie for 400 pounds damages and when the case
came before Judge Willis on 12 January 1842, the jury with John
Pascoe Fawkner as foreman, awarded McAlpine 141 pounds 15
shillings for the loss of the potatoes, said to be about 12 tons.
On 15 January 1841 Ferrie obtained a loan of 1000 pounds
secured by a mortgage of portion 21 'known by the name
Glenferrie together with the farmhouse and other buildings
thereon'. When a census was taken in March 1841 Ferrie's
household's return confirmed that he was occupying the land and
had named it Glen Ferrie. The Port Phillip Directory for 1841 gave
his address as Glen Ferrie Yarra Yarra. There were 18 residents,

This original artwork is thought to have been painted in the 1840s to 1850s, when
Glenferrie was owned by the Damyon family. This is one of two paintings that were in
the possession of the family in Argentina. Descendants recently forwarded copies of
both to the Archives.

had squatted on land north of Kooyong Koot Creek in 1836.
In 1842 Ferrie sold some town land and began selling lots in
Fitzroy but by 1843 he was in financial trouble and was unable
to meet his commitments under the mortgage of Glen Ferrie and
lost it. Other creditors were pressing him and on 13 March 1843
he assigned 37 lots in Fitzroy to a trustee for the benefit of his
creditors. His later movements are obscure until 30 August 1854
when, living at South Yarra, he took action against the trustee
alleging fraudulent disposal of some of the trust property. Some
further sales of his land were recorded in 1855 and the last one
took place on 13 April 1858, the conveyance of which was
signed by an attorney on behalf of Ferrie.
In 1857 Glenferrie Road was named Barkly Road after the

After Ernest died in 1911, the family battled to make ends meet. Percy attended state schools at Katanning, Boulder and Perth, and left school at 16. He worked in Perth, at one stage as a messenger at Parliament House, until about 1922 when he went north to the Pilbara and learned droving and blacksmithing on Indee station, 30 miles (48 km) south of Port Hedland. Then he moved to Yandeyarra station, 30 miles (48 km) further south, as a stationhand. He gradually built up a droving plant, got a team of mostly Aboriginal stockmen together, and took contracts. Stopped by drought in 1931, he turned to prospecting while employed part time on White Springs station, next to Yandeyarra. In the mid-1930s he settled at nearby Wodgina, a tantalite mine, blacksmithing, prospecting and occasionally working cattle for White Springs. He was his own man, well used to looking after himself in that tough country.

Early in World War II Gratwick tried to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, but was rejected because his nose had been broken years before. He paid a lot of money to have it fixed, tried again, and was accepted on 20 December 1940. After training he sailed from Perth on 5 July 1941, leaving instructions that his horses not be sold or destroyed. In September he joined the 2nd/48th Battalion under siege at Tobruk, Libya. 'I'm home and pleased and proud to be able to piss in the same pot with such a fine crowd', he told his brother. A month later the 2nd/48th was sent to Palestine. In June 1942 it arrived in Egypt, and in July fought at Tel el Eisa. Gratwick was held in reserve, rejoining his battalion on 10 August. Its next battle, his first, was El Alamein.

Just after midnight on 26 October the 2nd/48th attacked Trig 29, a slight elevation overlooking flat, rocky country even barer than the Pilbara, and powerfully defended by the Germans. Gratwick's platoon was pinned down by heavy fire: its leaders were killed, and it was reduced to seven men. The ground ahead sloped down then up, and both slopes were dotted with mortar and machine-gun posts. As he had done all his adult life, Gratwick asked no one what to do. His mates saw him rise suddenly into the German fire and charge forward, a grenade in one hand, rifle and bayonet in the other. A German sub-machine-gunner stood up and opened fire on him, but Gratwick reached the nearest post and hurled in two grenades, killing its occupants, including a mortar crew. Then he charged the sub-machine-gunner's post. He was mortally hit as he reached it, but silenced the occupants before he died. Inspired, his mates advanced, the Germans fell back, and the ground was captured. Gratwick was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

Percy Gratwick was 5 ft 10 ins (178 cm) tall and of medium build, quiet and resourceful, a practical joker, a bachelor who loved children, a bushman who thought city people had profit-and-loss minds. He measured people by their actions. He lived and died by that belief. In Perth, and in the desert country he came from, people honoured his memory. About 1948 a hill on White Springs was named Mount Gratwick, in 1956 the Gratwick Soldiers' Club was opened at Campbell Barracks, Perth, and in the 1960s Port Hedland named its hall, its swimming pool and a street after him.

The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation for Lorne and other coastal communities.

Before the road, travel between the coastal settlements was far from pleasant. In the 1870s, a trip from Lorne to Geelong was long and arduous via a rough coach track through dense bush to the railway at Winchelsea. Previously the ocean supplied the link to the outside world.

Early plans
Plans for an ocean road emerged in the 1880s but only gained real impetus towards the end of World War I. The chairman of the Country Roads Board, Mr W Calder, contacted the State War Council with a proposal that funds be provided for repatriation and re-employment of returned soldiers on roads in sparsely populated areas. Calder submitted a plan he described as the &#39;South Coast Road&#39; which suggested a road starting at Barwon Heads, following the coast around Cape Otway and ending near Warrnambool.

Making it a reality
It was Geelong mayor Alderman Howard Hitchcock who brought the plans to fruition. He formed the Great Ocean Road Trust and set about raising the money to finance the project. He saw it not only as a way of employing returned soldiers but of creating a lasting monument to those who had died in the war.

He also had a powerful view of its worth as a tourist attraction, proclaiming it better for its ocean, mountain, river and fern gully scenery than the Riviera in France, the San Francisco Road and Bulli Pass in New South Wales.

Manual enthusiasm
Survey work began in August 1918 and thousands of returned soldiers descended on the area to start work. It was back-breaking work with no heavy machinery to help - only picks, shovels and horse-drawn carts.

The first stage linking Lorne and Eastern View was completed in early 1922. Over the next decade, the trust continued its work on the Great Ocean Road linking Lorne with Cape Patton and Anglesea, while the Country Roads Board built the Cape Patton to Apollo Bay link.

And finally, a road
On 26 November 1932 the route was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor, Sir William Irvine. It was a sight to see with a procession of 40 cars and schoolchildren lining parts of the route.

Road travellers during the early years paid a toll at gates at Eastern View, where a memorial arch was erected. Drivers paid two shillings and sixpence and passengers one shilling and sixpence. The toll was abolished when the Trust moved to hand over the road as a gift to the State Government on 2 October 1936.",,,,,,1932.0,Website,Visit Melbourne,,8.0,6.0,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,Visit Victoria,Building the Great Ocean Road,Great Ocean Road,https://www.visitmelbourne.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Things-to-do/History-and-heritage/Building-t,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.099384 -38.4654491)

The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation for Lorne and other coastal communities.

Before the road, travel between the coastal settlements was far from pleasant. In the 1870s, a trip from Lorne to Geelong was long and arduous via a rough coach track through dense bush to the railway at Winchelsea. Previously the ocean supplied the link to the outside world.

Early plans
Plans for an ocean road emerged in the 1880s but only gained real impetus towards the end of World War I. The chairman of the Country Roads Board, Mr W Calder, contacted the State War Council with a proposal that funds be provided for repatriation and re-employment of returned soldiers on roads in sparsely populated areas. Calder submitted a plan he described as the &#39;South Coast Road&#39; which suggested a road starting at Barwon Heads, following the coast around Cape Otway and ending near Warrnambool.

Making it a reality
It was Geelong mayor Alderman Howard Hitchcock who brought the plans to fruition. He formed the Great Ocean Road Trust and set about raising the money to finance the project. He saw it not only as a way of employing returned soldiers but of creating a lasting monument to those who had died in the war.

He also had a powerful view of its worth as a tourist attraction, proclaiming it better for its ocean, mountain, river and fern gully scenery than the Riviera in France, the San Francisco Road and Bulli Pass in New South Wales.

Manual enthusiasm
Survey work began in August 1918 and thousands of returned soldiers descended on the area to start work. It was back-breaking work with no heavy machinery to help - only picks, shovels and horse-drawn carts.

The first stage linking Lorne and Eastern View was completed in early 1922. Over the next decade, the trust continued its work on the Great Ocean Road linking Lorne with Cape Patton and Anglesea, while the Country Roads Board built the Cape Patton to Apollo Bay link.

Calder submitted a plan he described as the &#39;South Coast Road&#39; which suggested a road starting at Barwon Heads, following the coast around Cape Otway and ending near Warrnambool.

Making it a reality
It was Geelong mayor Alderman Howard Hitchcock who brought the plans to fruition. He formed the Great Ocean Road Trust and set about raising the money to finance the project. He saw it not only as a way of employing returned soldiers but of creating a lasting monument to those who had died in the war.

He also had a powerful view of its worth as a tourist attraction, proclaiming it better for its ocean, mountain, river and fern gully scenery than the Riviera in France, the San Francisco Road and Bulli Pass in New South Wales.

Manual enthusiasm
Survey work began in August 1918 and thousands of returned soldiers descended on the area to start work. It was back-breaking work with no heavy machinery to help - only picks, shovels and horse-drawn carts.

The first stage linking Lorne and Eastern View was completed in early 1922. Over the next decade, the trust continued its work on the Great Ocean Road linking Lorne with Cape Patton and Anglesea, while the Country Roads Board built the Cape Patton to Apollo Bay link.

And finally, a road
On 26 November 1932 the route was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor, Sir William Irvine. It was a sight to see with a procession of 40 cars and schoolchildren lining parts of the route.

Road travellers during the early years paid a toll at gates at Eastern View, where a memorial arch was erected. Drivers paid two shillings and sixpence and passengers one shilling and sixpence. The toll was abolished when the Trust moved to hand over the road as a gift to the State Government on 2 October 1936.",,,,,,1932.0,Website,Visit Melbourne,,8.0,6.0,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,Visit Victoria,Building the Great Ocean Road,Great Ocean Road,https://www.visitmelbourne.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Things-to-do/History-and-heritage/Building-t,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (142.6686259 -38.4365733)

The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation for Lorne and other coastal communities.

Before the road, travel between the coastal settlements was far from pleasant. In the 1870s, a trip from Lorne to Geelong was long and arduous via a rough coach track through dense bush to the railway at Winchelsea. Previously the ocean supplied the link to the outside world.

The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation for Lorne and other coastal communities.

Before the road, travel between the coastal settlements was far from pleasant. In the 1870s, a trip from Lorne to Geelong was long and arduous via a rough coach track through dense bush to the railway at Winchelsea. Previously the ocean supplied the link to the outside world.

Early plans
Plans for an ocean road emerged in the 1880s but only gained real impetus towards the end of World War I. The chairman of the Country Roads Board, Mr W Calder, contacted the State War Council with a proposal that funds be provided for repatriation and re-employment of returned soldiers on roads in sparsely populated areas. Calder submitted a plan he described as the &#39;South Coast Road&#39; which suggested a road starting at Barwon Heads, following the coast around Cape Otway and ending near Warrnambool.

Making it a reality
It was Geelong mayor Alderman Howard Hitchcock who brought the plans to fruition. He formed the Great Ocean Road Trust and set about raising the money to finance the project. He saw it not only as a way of employing returned soldiers but of creating a lasting monument to those who had died in the war.

He also had a powerful view of its worth as a tourist attraction, proclaiming it better for its ocean, mountain, river and fern gully scenery than the Riviera in France, the San Francisco Road and Bulli Pass in New South Wales.

Manual enthusiasm
Survey work began in August 1918 and thousands of returned soldiers descended on the area to start work. It was back-breaking work with no heavy machinery to help - only picks, shovels and horse-drawn carts.

The first stage linking Lorne and Eastern View was completed in early 1922. Over the next decade, the trust continued its work on the Great Ocean Road linking Lorne with Cape Patton and Anglesea, while the Country Roads Board built the Cape Patton to Apollo Bay link.

Calder submitted a plan he described as the &#39;South Coast Road&#39; which suggested a road starting at Barwon Heads, following the coast around Cape Otway and ending near Warrnambool.

Making it a reality
It was Geelong mayor Alderman Howard Hitchcock who brought the plans to fruition. He formed the Great Ocean Road Trust and set about raising the money to finance the project. He saw it not only as a way of employing returned soldiers but of creating a lasting monument to those who had died in the war.

He also had a powerful view of its worth as a tourist attraction, proclaiming it better for its ocean, mountain, river and fern gully scenery than the Riviera in France, the San Francisco Road and Bulli Pass in New South Wales.

Manual enthusiasm
Survey work began in August 1918 and thousands of returned soldiers descended on the area to start work. It was back-breaking work with no heavy machinery to help - only picks, shovels and horse-drawn carts.

The first stage linking Lorne and Eastern View was completed in early 1922. Over the next decade, the trust continued its work on the Great Ocean Road linking Lorne with Cape Patton and Anglesea, while the Country Roads Board built the Cape Patton to Apollo Bay link.

And finally, a road
On 26 November 1932 the route was officially opened by the Lieutenant Governor, Sir William Irvine. It was a sight to see with a procession of 40 cars and schoolchildren lining parts of the route.

Road travellers during the early years paid a toll at gates at Eastern View, where a memorial arch was erected. Drivers paid two shillings and sixpence and passengers one shilling and sixpence. The toll was abolished when the Trust moved to hand over the road as a gift to the State Government on 2 October 1936.",,,,,,1932.0,Website,Visit Melbourne,,8.0,6.0,2021.0,,,,,,,,,,,Visit Victoria,Building the Great Ocean Road,Great Ocean Road,https://www.visitmelbourne.com/Regions/Great-Ocean-Road/Things-to-do/History-and-heritage/Building-t,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (143.2530585 -38.7327433)

The Great Ocean Road is permanent memorial to those who died while fighting in World War I carved in rock. Built by returned servicemen, it winds around the rugged southern coast and was a huge engineering feat ending decades of isolation for Lorne and other coastal communities.

Before the road, travel between the coastal settlements was far from pleasant. In the 1870s, a trip from Lorne to Geelong was long and arduous via a rough coach track through dense bush to the railway at Winchelsea. Previously the ocean supplied the link to the outside world.

Educated at Caulfield Grammar School and Wesley College, he became an interstate commercial traveller in the softgoods trade. On enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force on 16 June 1915, after nine months service in the Victorian Rangers, he was posted to the 37th Battalion. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 January 1916 and promoted lieutenant on 1 May; a month later the battalion embarked for training in England. When the 10th Light Trench Mortar Battery was organized there Grieve was seconded to it in January 1917 but on 19 April he rejoined the 37th Battalion in France, receiving his captaincy and the command of 'A' Company. The appointment was well received by his fellow soldiers who respected his quiet, understanding style of command.

The 37th Battalion took part in no major action, although its strength had been tested in several sharp raids, until the battle of Messines in June. Grieve was to receive the Victoria Cross for gallantry in this attack. Before the battle the unit made a detailed study of its role and Grieve ensured that his men were as fully informed as possible. On the night of 6 June the 37th began its approach march and soon suffered an intensive gas-attack. Just before dawn it reached its assembly trenches, moved about 11 a.m. towards its objective and came under heavy shell-fire; the resulting casualties, with those of the previous night, seriously depleted its strength.

In the afternoon of 7 June, Grieve's company was in position on the battalion's left flank. In front of its objective lay a thick band of wire and as the company ran through several gaps it came under intense fire from a German pillbox. An attempt to mortar this strong point was unsuccessful. Grieve, the only unwounded officer in 'A' Company, decided to attack the pillbox alone. Taking a supply of Mills bombs he dashed forward, taking cover wherever possible. His well-aimed grenades silenced some of the gunners, allowing him time to reach the nearby trench and bomb the rest of the machine-gun crew. His company was then able to advance and had scarcely gained its objective when a sniper's bullet severely wounded Grieve in the shoulder. He was the first member of the 3rd Division to win the Victoria Cross.

He was evacuated to England and returned to his unit on 29 October but soon afterwards suffered acute trench nephritis and double pneumonia and was invalided to Australia in May 1918. On 7 August, at Scots Church, Sydney, he married Sister May Isabel Bowman of the Australian Army Nursing Service who had nursed him during his illness. She died some years later and there were no children of the marriage. After demobilization Grieve established the business of Grieve, Gardner & Co., softgoods warehousemen, in Flinders Lane, Melbourne, and was managing director until 4 October 1957 when he died of cardiac failure; he had suffered from nephritis since 1917. He was buried with military honours in Springvale cemetery.

Educated at the local state school and at Stott's Business College, Perth, Stan began work with a real-estate agent. From June 1927 he was employed as a clerk and meter-fixer with the City of Perth Electricity and Gas Department. An enthusiastic cyclist, he won a number of road-races and officiated at fixtures conducted by the League of Western Australian Wheelmen.

Quiet, unassuming, 173 cm tall and of solid build, Gurney stated that he was an Anglican when he enlisted on 6 December 1940 in the Australian Imperial Force. In July 1941 he embarked for the Middle East and on 12 September joined the 2nd/48th Battalion at Tobruk, Libya; the 2nd/48th was sent to Palestine in October and to Syria in January 1942.

As part of the 26th Brigade, 9th Division, the battalion was deployed to Egypt in June to meet the threat posed by Axis forces pushing east towards El Alamein. Tel el Eisa lay approximately 16 km to the west, near the coast. The division was ordered to mount an attack on 22 July; the 2nd/48th's role was to capture Tel el Eisa Ridge. Major General Sir Leslie Morshead protested to the British commander-in-chief, General Sir Claude Auchinleck, that the plan was ill-conceived, pointing out that inadequate support would be provided. Because the 26th Brigade had to hold its existing ground, the 2nd/24th and 2nd/48th battalions could each spare only two companies for the assault and these would lack reinforcements. Yet the operation went ahead.

The 2nd/48th's 'D' Company, with Private Gurney in No.17 Platoon, crossed its start-line about 6.00 a.m. on 22 July, came under intense fire and began to take heavy casualties. Using a captured post as a fire-support position, 17 Platoon pushed on. Gurney carried a cumbersome Boyes anti-tank rifle. His platoon commander, Lieutenant Jim Wearing-Smith, recalled: 'Stan came up to me and I said, ''For Christ sake drop that bloody Boyes, you'll do better with a rifle!""' Within the next few moments Wearing-Smith was critically wounded and the platoon sergeant was killed. Carrying a rifle and bayonet, Gurney rushed over open ground through a hail of fire, bayoneted three Germans and captured their machine-gun post. He then charged a second emplacement, bayoneted two of the enemy and sent back one prisoner. While preparing to attack a third post, he was blown off his feet by a grenade burst. Undeterred, he stormed the position. His comrades saw him 'using the bayonet with great vigour' before he disappeared from view and was killed.

Gurney's body was found and buried in El Alamein war cemetery; he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1994 his family presented it to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. The Stan Gurney V.C. Memorial Bike Race, held annually in Western Australia, commemorates him.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Peter Bune,,,,1996.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biograpy, Australian National University","Gurney, Arthur Stanley (1908-1942)","Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gurney-arthur-stanley-10381,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.892822 -36.1447272)

of the Haverbrack Estate. The subdivision of the Town
Hall Estate, with 'business mansion and villa sites in the
most valuable aristocratic part', created residential building
allotments in Haverbrack Avenue and Embling Road, and
commercial allotments in Glenferrie Road and Malvern Road.
The original homestead Haverbrack, is shown on the 1888
sale notice. Haverbrack, a pre-fabricated iron house had been
imported from England around 1854. The house was erected
in Glenferrie Road by Scottish born Colin Campbell (1817-
1903), pastoralist, politician, author, educationist and cleric.
Haverbrack was used as the district's first Sunday School,
before it held the first services for St George's Church.
Following the 1888 subdivision, Orchard House was built
in 1902 in Haverbrack Avenue, by civil engineer, George
Higgins. Higgins' house is thought to have been named after
Haverbrack's orchard, which was possibly on the site of the
new house.
George Higgins was a Professor of Engineering at the
University of Melbourne. Born in Tipperary, Ireland, George
was the son of Irish-born Wesleyan minister, Rev. John
Higgins (1819-1895) and his wife, Anne (Bournes) (1825-
1917).
Orchard House shared a rear boundary with Killenna, the
Higgins' family home in Sorrett Avenue. The family had
arrived in Melbourne from Ireland in 1870. In 1875, George
enrolled at the University of Melbourne in Civil Engineering,
completing a degree in civil engineering in 1877 and a degree
in mining engineering in 1879. He returned as a Lecturer in
Surveying, Civil Engineering and Hydraulic Engineering.
George entered the Victorian Railways Dept as a student,
and while there prepared competitive designs for the Swan
Street, Victoria Street and Princes Bridges and the Drainage
and Sewerage of Melbourne. Following a trip to California,
Higgins was responsible for the construction of the first
successful suction dredge in Australasia, used to reclaim the Elwood Swamp and the West Melbourne Canal and Dock.
Source: Varsity Engineer, June 2011
Around the time of George's graduation, the Higgins family built Killenna a large house in Sorrett Avenue now demolished.
George's brother Henry Bournes Higgins (1851-1929), radical politician and Judge lived nearby at his mansion Doona
(demolished) in Glenferrie Road. The Higgins electorate takes his name. A sister, Anna was among the first women to enter
the university and another sister Ina, was a horticulturist, landscape gardener and feminist. Professor George Higgins died
in 1943.
From the 1920s to the 1960s, 6 Haverbrack Avenue underwent various alterations and additions. Architects for these plans
included Ballantyne & Wilson and Grounds Romberg & Boyd (1955). The same year 60' of land was excised from the
property. The house was demolished after the 2008 sale.",,,,,,,Newspaper,Malvern Historical Society,Orchard House,,,2020.0,,,4,,,,86,,MHS Local History News ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (145.0297641 -37.8535273)

His son, Robert Alexander David (Alec) Hood (1863-1934) was a prominent Western District pastoralist and sheep breeder and a member of the Mortlake Shire Council for thirty-three years.

However, as Hood Street was named before 1861 this seems too soon after Robert Hood arrived in the area to have been named after him. At the time a number of streets and towns in Victoria were being named after Crimean War heroes (e.g. Raglan, Tylden, etc) so it could be named for Admiral Arthur William Acland Hood (1824-1901) who fought in the Siege of Sebastopol.

He settled in Orange, NSW. On 17 January 1900 he was commissioned lieutenant in the New South Wales Medical Corps and sailed with the 2nd Contingent for South Africa. While with a mounted infantry brigade during the action of Vredefort on 24 July, Howse 'went out under a heavy crossfire and picked up a wounded man and carried him to a place of shelter'. He was awarded the Victoria Cross on 4 June 1901. After returning to Australia, he went back to South Africa as an honorary major in the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) in February 1902. He married Evelyn Gertrude Northcote Pilcher in January 1905. In August 1914 he was appointed principal medical officer to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to German New Guinea. He sent drugs and medical equipment suitable for a tropical campaign and the troops were protected against typhoid and smallpox. The brief action in New Britain was completed without a single case of serious illness up to 15 October as a result of his thoroughness. Howse returned alone just in time to join the Australian Imperial Force and sail with the first convoy as staff officer to Surgeon General W. C. D. Williams, director of medical services. He was appointed assistant director of medical services, 1st Australian Division. He was gravely perturbed by the inadequacy and confusion of the Imperial forces' medical plan for the Gallipoli landing and obtained improvements in the arrangements for the evacuation of Australian wounded. When the perilous situation at the landing made his plans impossible he took personal charge of the evacuation under increasing shell-fire. He strove to improve sanitation and food, to expedite the return of the wounded to units and, after Gallipoli, to combat venereal disease and to resist every attempt to lower the physical standard of the A.I.F. On Gallipoli he established the Anzac Medical Society which met regularly to disseminate knowledge among his officers. In July 1915 he was appointed C.B. and in September was given command of the medical services, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, as deputy director; from November he was director of medical services of the A.I.F. When the infantry divisions went to France in 1916 Howse set up his headquarters with A.I.F. administrative headquarters in London. He retained control of the A.A.M.C. in Egypt and Palestine, made frequent visits to the A.I.F. in France and reported each month to the director general of medical services in Melbourne. Among his achievements were recognition by the army of the need for direct access by the director of medical services to the general officer commanding the A.I.F., and his acceptance by the War Office as chief medical officer of the A.I.F. In the field Howse had introduced surgical teams and had supported the work of Major A. W. Holmes Ã¿  Court in developing resuscitation teams with each division. He assisted with the medical repatriation process after the war. Howse returned home in January 1920, where he continued his work in public health. He was elected to the House of Representatives as a member of the National Party in 1922 and entered cabinet in 1925. He was commissioned by the government to inquire into the medical examination of migrants and the treatment of TB. In his parliamentary career he was recognised as champion of returned servicemen and as a pioneer in public health. He spoke on the need to improve public health, on the treatment of cancer and venereal disease, maternity allowances and the welfare of returned servicemen. He set up one of the world's first radium banks and helped to found the Federal Health Council and the College of Surgeons of Australasia. He died of cancer on 19 September 1930 and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery, London.",,,Yes,,,,Website,A. J.

He was educated at North Adelaide Public School and Broken Hill Model School. Inwood worked as a miner at Broken Hill. In August 1914 he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 10th Battalion. Embarking in October, he served at Gallipoli until November 1915. He was promoted lance corporal in August. By April 1916 the battalion was in France. Inwood, who had been promoted temporary corporal in August was in October reduced to private, owing to absence without leave. In the battle of Menin Road in September 1917 the 10th Battalion attacked at Polygon Wood. 'During the advance to the second objective, [Inwood] passed through our barrage, and alone captured a strong post, killing several and capturing nine. He volunteered for a special night-long patrol. He went out 600 yards [549 m] and sent back the most valuable information. Early on the morning of 21 September Inwood went out alone and located and bombed a machine-gun. He killed the crew and brought in the one survivor with the gun'. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for 'most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty'. Although the citation states that Inwood went out alone on this attack, the Official History, the unit history and Inwood's own statement confirm that he was assisted, however briefly, by another man. Promoted corporal in October 1917, and later sergeant, Inwood served with the 10th Battalion until May 1918. He embarked for Australia on 24 August and was demobilized in Adelaide in December. Returning to a hero's welcome at Broken Hill in October Inwood contrasted, in a public speech, his departure when he was, he claimed, 'stoned by mongrels at the train', with his return when 'those mongrels were the first to ... shake me by the hand ... If the boys stick together like they did in France there will be no Bolshevikism in this town ... I would like to be at one end of the street with a machine-gun and have them at the other end'. Departing recruits had been hooted and jeered by militant socialists at Broken Hill but there is no evidence of stone-throwing. M. P. Considine, member for Barrier in the House of Representatives, accused Inwood of trying 'to incite trouble between returned soldiers and the working classes'. Broken Hill was not a comfortable place for Inwood. He soon moved to Adelaide and on 31 December 1918 married a widow Mabel Alice Collins, nee Weber. Inwood had difficulty in finding work. After an assault charge by police, which resulted in a fine in 1919, and his divorce in 1921, he spent a short time mining at Queenstown, Tasmania, and at a eucalyptus distillery on Kangaroo Island. He returned to Adelaide and was employed by the city council as a labourer in 1928-55. During World War II he served as a warrant officer with the Australian Military Forces. Inwood married Evelyn Owens in 1927 and after her death married Louise Elizabeth Gates in 1942. He had no children. A rugged, independent, well-built man, 'with the rough corners still on him', the years after his third marriage were spent happily and quietly. This loyal labourer, perhaps exploited by some at Broken Hill, gave the impression that 'his VC had not done him much good'. He never lost his pride in the 10th Battalion and always marched with them on Anzac Day. The Other Ranks Mess, 10th Battalion, Torrens Parade Ground, Adelaide, is called the Roy Inwood Club. His Victoria Cross hangs in the council chambers of the Adelaide City Council. He died on 23 October 1971, was given a military funeral and was buried in West Terrace cemetery.

The family moved to Wedderburn when Albert was 5. After elementary schooling, Bert worked for the Victorian State Forests Department. 
Jacka enlisted in September 1914 as a private in the 14th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. His unit spent two months training in Egypt before landing at Anzac Cove on 26 April 1915. On 19 May the Turks launched a massive counter-attack. Amid frenzied fighting at Courtney's Post some Turks captured a 11m section of trench, one end of which was guarded by Jacka. For several minutes he fired warning shots into the trench wall until reinforcements arrived and, after shouting his instructions, he and three others sprang out into the trench. All but Jacka were immediately hit so he leapt back into the communication trench. Two bombs were lobbed at the Turks while Jacka skirted around to attack from the flank. Amid the smoke and the noise he clambered over the parapet, shot five Turks and bayoneted two as the rest hastily retreated. For this action he received the Victoria Cross, the first to be awarded to the A.I.F. in the war.
Jacka became a national hero. He rose quickly through the ranks, passing officer training and was commissioned 2nd lieutenant in April 1916.
Jacka's platoon moved into the line near PoziÃ¿Â¨res, France, on the night of 6-7 August 1916. German troops overran a part of the line at dawn. Jacka had just completed a reconnaissance and had gone to his dug-out when two Germans appeared at its entrance and rolled a bomb down the doorway, killing two men. Jacka charged up the dug-out steps, firing as he moved, and came upon a large number of the enemy rounding up some forty Australians as prisoners. He rallied his platoon and charged at the enemy, some of whom immediately threw down their rifles. Furious hand-to-hand fighting erupted as the prisoners turned on their captors. Fifty Germans were captured and the line was retaken. Jacka was awarded a Military Cross. The entire platoon was wounded, Jacka seriously in the neck and shoulder. He received further promotions. 
On 8 April 1917 Jacka led a night reconnaissance party into no man's land near Bullecourt to inspect enemy defences before an attack against the new German line. He penetrated the wire at two places, reported back, then went out again to supervise the laying of tapes to guide the infantry. The work was virtually finished when two Germans loomed up. Realizing that they would see the tapes, Jacka knew that they must be captured. He pulled his pistol; it misfired, so he rushed on and captured them by hand.For  this action he was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross.
He was wounded by a sniper's bullet near Ploegsteert Wood on 8 July. In May 1918 he was badly gassed at Villers-Bretonneux and saw no more action. In September 1919 he embarked for Australia where a large crowd, met him. He was demobilized in January 1920. Shortly after his return he formed an import export business with two former comrades. 
On 17 January 1921 Jacka had married Frances Veronica Carey, a typist from his office. They settled at St Kilda and later adopted a daughter. In September 1929 Jacka was elected to the St Kilda Council and became mayor a year later. He devoted most of his energies on council to assisting the unemployed. His own business flourished until 1929 when the Scullin government increased import tariffs and the company went into voluntary liquidation in September 1930. Jacka then became a commercial traveller with the Anglo-Dominion Soap Co.
He died on 17 January 1932. Nearly 6000 people filed past his coffin when it lay in state in Anzac House. The funeral procession, led by over 1000 returned soldiers flanked by thousands of onlookers, made its way to St Kilda cemetery where he was buried with full military honours.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Kevin J.

After attending Dudley Primary School, where he excelled at cricket, and the Newcastle Collegiate and High schools, he was apprenticed to his father as a mining engineer. A young man of high standards and ideals, he strove to excel in all he did. Jeffries had a particular interest in the study of breeding thoroughbreds, although not in racing them, and always kept fine horses.

His military service began in the militia when he was 14. He joined the 14th (Hunter River) Infantry Regiment as a private in July 1912 under the compulsory training scheme, and was promoted sergeant a year later. Commissioned second lieutenant on 22 August 1914, he was mobilized for home defence duties and instructed volunteers for the Australian Imperial Force at Newcastle and Liverpool camps. He was promoted lieutenant in July 1915. On 1 February 1916 Jeffries, then in charge of the Abermain Collieries surveying department, was appointed second lieutenant in the 34th Battalion, A.I.F., and three months later embarked for England. In August he was promoted lieutenant and in November his battalion moved to the Western Front where he spent the early months of 1917 on front-line service in the ArmentiÃ¿Â¨res sector, France. Highly respected by those serving under him and by his superiors, his first major action was at Messines where, on 9 June, he was wounded in the thigh while leading a reconnaissance patrol. Promoted captain on 26 June, Jeffries rejoined his unit in September.

On 12 October, in the attack on Passchendaele during the third phase of the battle of Ypres, his company's advance towards its first objective was held up by two pill-boxes. He organized and led a bombing party which eliminated the obstacle and captured thirty-five prisoners and four machine-guns. He then led his company forward, under an extremely heavy enemy artillery barrage and enfilade machine-gun fire, to the objective. Later that morning the battalion's advance to its second objective was delayed by a machine-gun post. Jeffries led another party to capture the position, enabling the advance to continue, but was killed during the operation. For his service that day he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, for 'most conspicuous bravery in attack'.

Jeffries was buried near Passchendaele, in the Tyne Cot military cemetery. His headstone is inscribed:

On Fame's eternal camping ground
Their silent tents are spread.
Upon his mother's death, his Victoria Cross was presented to Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle. Elsewhere, he is commemorated by photographic portraits in the Abermain Memorial and Citizens' Club, a carved chair presented to Abermain Holy Trinity Anglican Church by his uncle and aunt, and by the Jeffries-Currey Memorial Library at Dudley Primary School where William Currey, V.C., had also been a pupil.",,,Yes,,,,Website,J.

Jensen won the Victoria Cross for 'most conspicuous bravery and initiative' on 2 April at Noreuil, one of the 'outpost villages' of the Hindenburg line. During its long advance towards the village the 50th Battalion came under enfiladed fire from a German forward machine-gun post which caused heavy casualties. Jensen, covered by another private, rushed the post with bombs. After eliminating the machine-gun crew with one of his bombs he threatened to throw the others and bluffed the German position into surrendering, taking about forty prisoners. Later that day, after a fierce fight, Noreuil was captured. Jensen served from July to October with the 13th Training Battalion and returned to the 50th on 6 October; he had been promoted lance corporal on 4 April, corporal on 4 July and temporary sergeant on 5 October. He was seriously wounded on 5 May 1918 while on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux and was invalided to Australia on 26 August.

Jensen was discharged from the A.I.F. in Adelaide on 12 December 1918 with the rank of corporal. After demobilization he worked as a marine store dealer. He married Katy Herman, nÃ¿Â©e Arthur, at the Adelaide Registry Office on 13 July 1921. Jensen died of war-related injuries in Adelaide Hospital on 31 May 1922.

Wong said it was quality pork, celery and cabbage and ""years of perfecting"" that the customers valued in his signature dim sims.

Dick attended technical college at Tralee and worked as a mechanic in his brother's garage. In 1929 he emigrated to Brisbane with his 15-year-old sister Norah. She later said that, although he was good natured and 'not a very big fellow', he 'wouldn't take it if anyone were nasty'. During the Depression he worked at a variety of jobs: he was sacristan at St Stephen's Cathedral before moving to the country where he was employed as a farmhand. Sickness dogged him, and he contracted typhoid and meningitis.

Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 21 February 1941, Kelliher sailed for the Middle East and was assigned to the 2nd/25th Battalion in October. He performed garrison duties in Syria and returned to Australia in March 1942. Six months later he was with his unit in Papua, helping to drive the Japanese from Ioribaiwa to Gona. Back home from January 1943, he was admitted to hospital with malaria in June. He was again sent to Papua in August. Next month he was based at Nadzab, New Guinea, whence the 2nd/25th advanced towards Lae.

On 13 September, near Heath's plantation, Kelliher's platoon came under heavy fire from a concealed Japanese machine-gun post. Five men were killed and three wounded, among them the section leader Corporal Billy Richards. On his own initiative, Kelliher dashed towards the post, hurled two grenades at the enemy and killed some of them, but was forced back to his own lines. Seizing a Bren-gun, he ran to within 30 yards (27 m) of the machine-gun nest and silenced it with accurate shooting. He then crawled out under enemy rifle-fire and dragged Richards to safety, probably saving his life. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.

After further spells in hospital with malaria, he was sent to Brisbane in November and posted to the 11th Australian Advanced Workshop next month. He took part in his old battalion's march through the city on 8 August 1944 and was discharged from the A.I.F. on 20 August 1945. In 1946 he was selected in the Australian contingent for the victory parade in London. King George VI presented him with his V.C.; the Kelliher family from County Kerry attended the investiture. Kelliher returned to London in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and in 1956 for the V.C. centenary celebrations. On each occasion he visited Tralee.

At Epworth Lodge, Bowen Hills, Brisbane, on 30 August 1949 Kelliher had married with Methodist forms Olive Margaret Hearn, a 19-year-old machinist. They moved to Melbourne where he worked as a gardener. He died of cerebral thrombosis on 28 January 1963 in the Repatriation General Hospital, Heidelberg, and was buried in Springvale cemetery with Catholic rites and military honours; his wife, son and two daughters survived him.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Richard E.

Known as Ted, born in Hamilton, Victoria as the fourth child in a family of 7. He attended St. Mary's Convent, Hamilton, but left at 14 and worked as a plumber to look after his mother when his father fell ill. He was an accomplished sportsman and keen cyclist. Ted served in the Citizen Military Forces before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Forces in 1940. He served initially in the 23rd/21st Battalion but was posted to the 2nd/4th in 1943. In October 1944 he embarked from Cairns with his unit bound for New Guinea. Japanese troops had established a defensive line in rugged terrain south of Wewak, New Guinea, and were shelling the Australians from the missionary station at Wirui. After a sharp battle on May 14, the 2nd/4th had captured all but the north-western spur. The only position from which supporting fire could be obtained was continuously swept by heavy machine-gun fire, making it impossible to bring artillery or mortars into action. On May 15, Private Kenna's platoon was ordered forward to deal with three enemy machine-gun posts. Kenna moved his support section as close as possible to the bunkers in order to provide covering fire for a flank attack by the rest of the platoon. Two sections of the platoon attacked, but as soon as the enemy spotted them they were pinned down with heavy automatic fire from a position which had not previously revealed itself. With several of the men already wounded, Kenna endeavoured to bring his gunner to bear on one of the bunkers but was unable to bring down effective fire because of the difficult ground. On his own initiative and without orders, Kenna stood up in full view of the enemy less than 50 yards away and engaged the bunker, firing his Bren gun from the hip. Fire was returned at once, bullets passing between his arms and his body but somehow missing him. Undeterred, Kenna continued to fire at the enemy until his ammunition was exhausted. He then discarded his Bren gun, called for a rifle and despite intense machine-gun fire killed the enemy gunner with his first round. When a machine gun opened up on him from a second position, Kenna, who had remained standing, killed the gunner with his next round. The bunker was captured without further loss, the company attack went forward and the enemy position was carried. Ted was invested with the Victoria Cross by the Governor-General of Australia at Government House, Melbourne, 6 January 1947. Kenna returned to work in Hamilton at the Borough hall and then as curator of the Melville Oval. He was presented to the Queen when she visited the newly-restored Hall of Memory at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in March 2000; he appeared on a postage stamp in the same year. A portrait of Kenna by Sir William Dargie hangs in the Borough hall.Ted Kenna married, in 1947, Marje Rushberry, who had nursed him in hospital after he was shot in the face in New Guinea.

Expanding from a business employing five people at this time to a business employing 365 in 1923, J. Kennon & Sons was a well-known landmark until it closed in 1960. Kennon sons were educated at Scotch College and many members of the extended Kennon family lived in the grand houses of Hawthorn over the years - for example, 'Manningtree' on Manningtree Road and 'Roslin' at 26 Yarra Street (prior to the First World War). J. W. Kennon, grandson of James Kennon, was instrumental in the early development of the Hawthorn Football Club, and today is honoured with a medallion hanging in the Hawthorn Football Club Hall of Fame. Along with Albion Henry Walkley, Squire Kennon, son of James, was a Foundation Member of the Glenferrie Hill Recreation Club. His son (grandson of James Kennon, cousin to J. W. Kennon), Edwin, continued the connection with Walkley, having many buildings designed by him. Walkley designed the residence 'Arcoona' on Wellesley Road for Edwin Kennon.

The name was sometimes spelt Keyzor. After education at Townley Castle, Ramsgate, Keysor spent ten years in Canada. He migrated to Sydney, where he found employment as a clerk, about three months before the outbreak of World War I. On 18 August 1914 he enlisted in the 1st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, and embarked for Egypt on 18 October. Keysor landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 and was promoted lance corporal on 20 June. His deeds during the second (and last) great effort to take the peninsula are among the most spectacular individual feats of the war.

At 5.30 p.m. on 6 August the 1st Australian Infantry Brigade launched a diversionary attack at Lone Pine and by nightfall had seized the Turkish trenches; but bitter fighting with bayonets and bombs continued for three days and nights as the Turks retaliated. Keysor, a master of bomb-throwing, scorned danger. As Turkish bombs lobbed into his trench he would leap forward and smother the explosions with sandbags or coat. If time allowed he would throw a bomb back; he caught several in flight and smartly returned them as though playing cricket. Twice wounded, he nevertheless maintained his efforts for fifty hours. His bravery saved his trench and removed the enemy from a temporarily commanding position. Charles Bean recorded that 'the battalions of the 1st Brigade lost so heavily that few witnesses of its efforts remained. Consequently of the seven Victoria Crosses awarded after this fight, four went to a reinforcing battalion'. Of the other three, one was awarded to Keysor.

After Lone Pine Keysor went to England suffering from enteric fever. Rejoining his battalion in France in March 1916, he took part in the fighting at PoziÃ¿Â¨res. On 17 November he was transferred to the 42nd Battalion and promoted sergeant on 1 December. Commissioned second lieutenant on 13 January 1917, he was promoted lieutenant in July. He was wounded on 28 March 1918 while fighting on the defensive MÃ¿Â©ricourt-Sailly-Le-Sec line and evacuated. Back with his unit, he was again wounded on 26 May in a gas bombardment near Villers-Bretonneux.

In October 1918 Keysor, an uncompromising advocate of conscription, returned to Australia with other veterans and assisted in the recruiting campaign. Discharged from the army as medically unfit on 12 December, he resumed clerical work but in 1920 he entered business in London. There, on 8 July at the Hill Street Synagogue, he married Gladys Benjamin.

Keysor was persuaded to re-enact his bomb-throwing exploits in a film, For Valour, in 1927, but he was essentially a shy man who shunned publicity. White-haired and deaf when interviewed in the 1940s, he described himself as 'a common-or-garden clock importer' and remarked that 'the war was the only adventure I ever had'. Keysor was rejected for military service in 1939 on medical grounds. He died in London of cancer on 12 October 1951, survived by his wife and daughter, and was cremated after a memorial service at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, St John's Wood.

It is possibly named after an aboriginal named Gillear who drowned in the lake. Or, it may be derived from Gilaa which is the Yuwaalaraay (Aboriginal language of southeast Australia) word for the Australian bird, the Galah.

An old spelling for the lake is ""Lake Kee Lia"", another, from an 1856 map calls it ""Gillier Lake"" and, from an 1866 map, ""Lake Galear"".

The street was named by Council on 2nd Aug 1872 and Council minutes show that it was named ""La Trobe"" - with a space. However, the usual spelling in Warrnambool has become Latrobe, i.e. as one word. 

The one-word spelling of Latrobe is by far the more common with 55 streets in Victoria called Latrobe and only 6 La Trobes, the best known being La Trobe Street in Melbourne. La Trobe himself signed his last name with one word.

Alby Lowerson had been dredging for gold at Adelong, New South Wales, before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in Melbourne on 16 July 1915; he was allotted to the 5th Reinforcements of the 21st Battalion which embarked in September.

Lowerson joined his unit on 7 January 1916 and accompanied it to France in March. After a period in the quiet ArmentiÃ¿Â¨res sector he entered the battle of the Somme, seeing heavy fighting for PoziÃ¿Â¨res Heights from 25 July to 7 August. Two weeks later he was back in the front lines near Mouquet Farm where he was wounded on 26 August. He rejoined the battalion a month later and was promoted corporal on 1 November. Promoted temporary sergeant on 11 April 1917, he was again wounded during the 2nd battle of Bullecourt on 3 May. It was six months before he rejoined his unit as sergeant on 1 November. In the final allied advance in 1918 he distinguished himself on 27 August at Virgin Wood and on 28 August at HerbÃ¿Â©court.

Lowerson won the Victoria Cross on 1 September during the capture of Mont St Quentin. He was cited for his leadership and courage during the battle, particularly for his effective bombing of the strong point which was the centre of stern resistance: a huge crater from which machine-guns fired and stick-bombs were hurled. He inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans and captured twelve machine-guns and thirty prisoners. Although wounded in the thigh he refused to withdraw until the prisoners had been sent to the rear and the posts of his men had been organized and consolidated. He then refused to leave the battalion for two days until evacuated because of his wound. He resumed duty on 17 September in time to participate in the last Australian infantry action of the war, at Montbrehain on 5 October where he was wounded for the fourth time. He received the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 1 March 1919; a month later he embarked for Australia and was discharged on 8 July.

Between the wars Lowerson was a dairy and tobacco farmer on a Victorian soldier settlement block. He named his property, on Merriang estate near Myrtleford, St Quentin. He married Edith Larkins at St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, on 1 February 1930. Re-enlisting on 5 July 1940, he served as a sergeant in various training units throughout Australia until discharged in 1944. Survived by his wife and daughter, he died of leukaemia at Myrtleford on 15 December 1945 and was buried there after a Methodist service. A memorial headstone was unveiled in 1949 and local returned servicemen make an annual pilgrimage to the grave. Myrtleford in 1966 named the A. D. Lowerson Memorial Swimming Pool in his honour.

After attending St Columba's School, Leichhardt, and Christian Brothers' High School, Lewisham, Jack moved with his family to Portland in 1936. Aged 14, he finished his formal education at St Joseph's Convent School that year.

Because jobs were scarce, young Mackey was apprenticed in his father's bakery. Of average height, stockily built and weighing about 13 stone (83 kg), he had blue eyes, reddish hair, and a humorous and exuberant nature. He played Rugby League football for the local junior team (and later for his battalion) and proved an excellent swimmer, but he disliked working in the bakery and living in the country. His relationship with his father became strained, particularly after his mother died in 1939. Defying his father, Jack overstated his age and enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1940. Stanislaus reluctantly accepted the situation.

Posted to the 2nd/3rd Pioneer Battalion, Mackey served in Darwin in 1941 before being sent to the Middle East where he saw action in the battle of El Alamein, Egypt (October-November 1942). He returned to Australia in February 1943, then sailed for Papua in August. During operations around Finschhafen, New Guinea, he was promoted acting corporal in October (substantive June 1944). His company commander described him as an outstanding junior leader who exhibited moral and physical courage. Mackey was hospitalized with malaria in November 1943-January 1944, and again in May-June and August-September 1944. With his battalion, he embarked for the invasion of Tarakan Island, Borneo, in April 1945 and landed on 1 May.

On 12 May 1945 Mackey led his section in an attack on a place code-named 'Helen'. This well-defended position dominated the surrounding vicinity and had to be approached along a precipitous spur, thick with jungle and barely wide enough for two men. Accompanied by his second-in-command, Lance Corporal A. R. 'Yorky' Riedy (who was to be awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in the action), Mackey scrambled up the ridge, throwing a smoke-grenade to mask their approach. For reasons best known to themselves, the Japanese held their fire and dragged both Australians into the first position they reached-a light-machine-gun post. In the ensuing fight the two men accounted for four enemy soldiers, but Riedy was wounded. Mackey then killed the remaining Japanese in the post, and dealt with a heavy-machine-gun and its crew in an adjacent bunker. Taking Riedy's Owen gun, he moved towards another heavy-machine-gun nest, farther up the slope. He reached and silenced this post, but was mortally wounded.

Buried where he fell, Mackey was finally laid to rest in Labuan war cemetery. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. His sister Pat received the decoration from the governor-general, the Duke of Gloucester; it was later presented to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Harry Taplin,,,,2000.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Mackey, John Bernard (Jack) (1922-1945) ","Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/mackey-john-bernard-jack-10993,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8957063 -36.1403511)

Seventh child in a close-knit Presbyterian family of ten, he was educated at Tatura State School and later worked on his father's properties at Tatura and Caniambo. Stocky and athletic, he excelled at football and shooting; his 'irrepressible sense of humour' and 'gentlemanly disposition' made him popular among the locals.

Mactier enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 1 March 1917 and embarked for England with the 19th Reinforcements for the 23rd Battalion. After training he joined the battalion in France on 23 November. Allotted to 'B' Company, in April 1918 he was in heavy fighting around Albert on the Somme and was gassed. In May he was a scout at company headquarters. He fought in the battle of Hamel in July and in the August offensive and on 22 August wrote his last letter home. Victory was in sight: 'if our side only keep going I think the war [will] be over by next spring'.

On 1 September, north of Peronne, Mactier won his battalion's only Victoria Cross. The 23rd was moving into position for the early morning assault on Mont St Quentin. With only twenty minutes left until zero hour, it was stopped by an enemy machine-gun behind a barbed-wire barricade. Two similar posts could be seen further on. An attack on the first position failed and Private Mactier, his company's runner, was sent to investigate. Armed with bombs and a revolver, he ran forward, sized up the situation and dashed to the barricade. He threw a bomb, climbed over the wire and toppled the machine-gun out of the trench. His comrades then advanced, found the eight-man gun-crew dead and saw Mactier capturing all occupants of the next post. He charged the third post, bombing and killing the garrison and discovered yet another obstacle. To avoid wire in the trench he ran into the open and was rushing in for his fourth attack when shot by a gunner on his flank, though one of his friends said that he was 'killed by concussion from a hand grenade'. Through his actions the assaulting companies filed into position just as the barrage fell on Mont St Quentin.

Mactier was buried nearby but was reinterred in the Hem Farm cemetery, Hem-Monacu. In noting his posthumous award the London Times praised his 'exceptional valour and determination', describing him as 'a fine type of the wiry Colonial'. His mates, in their battalion newspaper, remembered him as 'only one of the boys' while his letters home are those of a genial unpretentious man. A radio series on V.C. winners, broadcast in 1936-37, ably summed him up: 'Bob Mactier was typical of his kind, the countryman who became a soldier ... a healthy man ... well-behaved ... quiet and unassuming; he had nothing spectacular in his make-up'. In 1983 his family donated his V.C. to the Australian War Memorial. His name is commemorated in a soldier's club at Watsonia Barracks, Melbourne, which also holds a bronze bust by Wallace Anderson.

Victory was in sight: 'if our side only keep going I think the war [will] be over by next spring'. 
He was killed in action on 1 September 1918 by a machine gun during the battle of Mont St. Quentin. He was awarded the Victoria Cross (the only one for 23rd Battalion) for his actions in this battle: 
'For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on the morning of the 1st September 1918, during the attack on the village of Mt. St. Quentin. Prior to the advance of the battalion, it was necessary to clear up several enemy strong points close to our line. This the bombing patrols sent forward failed to effect, and the battalion was unable to move. Private Mactier, singlehanded, and in daylight, thereupon jumped out of the trench, rushed past the block, closed with an killed the machine gun garrison of eight men with his revolver and bombs, and threw the enemy machine gun over the parapet. Then, rushing forward about 20 yards, he jumped into another strong point held by a garrison of six men, who immediately surrendered. Continuing to the next block through the trench, he disposed of an enemy machine gun which had been enfilading our flank advancing troops, and was then killed by another machine gun at close range. It was entirely due to this exceptional valour and determination of Private Mactier that the battalion was able to move on to its 'jumping off' trench and carry out the successful operation of capturing the village of Mt. St. Quentin a few hours later'.

Martha was very active in the community and she described many events, among which was one of the first church services at St Paul&#39;s, Bakery Hill, where she questioned the purpose of the branches of gum leaves near the altar. She soon discovered that these were to combat the masses of flies that swarmed into the building in hot weather! Quite an initiation for immigrants from the cooler climes of England and Ireland! Martha took an active interest in community affairs. She was a member of St Paul&#39;s Church of England, treasurer of the Ladies Benevolent Clothing Society, and was one of the 26 women who helped establish the Ballarat Female Refuge in 1867, the first institution of its nature for single mothers on the Australian goldfields.

He was named Edgar Leslie Cecil Willis Walker Maygar. Leslie was educated at Alexandra and Kilmore State schools and privately. He was nearly 6 ft (183 cm), and had brown hair and later a Kitchener moustache. He, his father and three brothers owned Strathearn station, Euroa. A very fine horseman, Maygar enlisted in the Victorian Mounted Rifles in March 1891.
At the start of the South African War he was not accepted among the first volunteers, owing to a decayed tooth, but went with the 5th (Mounted Rifles) Contingent, arriving in Cape Town in March 1901. For twelve months the contingent was constantly in action, north of Middelburg, East Transvaal, then at Rhenoster Kop, Klippan, Kornfontein and Drivelfontein. It was transferred to Natal in August. At Geelhoutboom, on 23 November, Lieutenant Maygar was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing a fellow Victorian whose horse had been shot. With the enemy only 200 yards (183 m) away Maygar dismounted, put the man on his own horse, told him to gallop for the British lines, and ran back under heavy fire. His V.C. was presented by Lord Kitchener. Before returning home in March 1902 he was also mentioned in dispatches.
Resuming work as a grazier at Euroa, Maygar also served as a lieutenant in the 8th (later 16th) Light Horse, V.M.R., and was promoted captain in 1905. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force soon after World War I broke out, lowering his age by four years. On 20 August 1914 he was appointed a captain in the 4th Light Horse Regiment and sailed for Egypt in October. On Gallipoli, with the dismounted light horse, he was promoted major. On 17 October 1915 he was given temporary command of the 8th L.H.R., both rank of lieutenant-colonel and command being confirmed in December. During the evacuation of Gallipoli Maygar, left in command of forty men, was instructed to hold the trenches, at all costs, till 2.30 a.m. He wrote: 'I had my usual good luck to be given command of the last party to pull out of the trenches, the post of honour for the 3rd L.H. Brigade'.
Maygar led his regiment throughout its service in Sinai and Palestine until his death and was a much-admired leader. During the 2nd battle of Gaza, on 19 April 1917, the 8th was in a most exposed sector and suffering heavy casualties. Maygar rode about the battlefield all day on his grey charger and 'in every crisis stirred the spirit of his regiment by his example in the firing line'. Sir Henry Gullett records that Maygar was 'always very bold in his personal leadership' and writes of 19 April: 'It was a day when true leaders recognised that their men needed inspiration, and Maygar gave it in the finest manner'. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1917, and was thrice mentioned in dispatches in 1916-18. When Brigadier General J. R. Royston was invalided home, Colonel Maygar acted as brigadier general in command of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.
Late on the day of the battle of Beersheba, 31 October 1917, a German aeroplane, using bombs and machine-guns, hit Maygar whose arm was shattered. The grey bolted into the darkness and was found later by 8th Regiment troopers but Maygar was not with him.

He was named Edgar Leslie Cecil Willis Walker Maygar. His father's family were originally political refugees from Hungary. Leslie was educated at Alexandra and Kilmore State schools and privately. He was nearly 6 ft (183 cm), and had brown hair and later a Kitchener moustache. He, his father and three brothers owned Strathearn station, Euroa. A very fine horseman, Maygar enlisted in the Victorian Mounted Rifles in March 1891.

At the start of the South African War he was not accepted among the first volunteers, owing to a decayed tooth, but went with the 5th (Mounted Rifles) Contingent, arriving in Cape Town in March 1901. For twelve months the contingent was constantly in action, north of Middelburg, East Transvaal, then at Rhenoster Kop, Klippan, Kornfontein and Drivelfontein. It was transferred to Natal in August. At Geelhoutboom, on 23 November, Lieutenant Maygar was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing a fellow Victorian whose horse had been shot. With the enemy only 200 yards (183 m) away Maygar dismounted, put the man on his own horse, told him to gallop for the British lines, and ran back under heavy fire.

His parents died when he was very young and he was brought up in Clontarf Orphanage, Perth, and educated in Catholic schools.
McCarthy was working as a contractor when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 16 October 1914; he was posted as a private to the 16th Battalion and sailed for Egypt in December. On 26 April 1915 'Fat'-the appropriate and affectionate nickname earned by his 'ample frame'-landed at Gallipoli with 'C' Company. In September he was evacuated because of illness, returning to duty in November. On 20 December he left Gallipoli with the last party of his battalion.
The 16th Battalion reached France in June 1916 and took part in heavy fighting around PoziÃ¿Â¨res and Mouquet Farm in August. He was wounded at Bullecourt and evacuated to England, rejoining his unit on 9 July. A lieutenant from 1 November, he received the French Croix de Guerre at Beaumetz two days later. From 31 January 1918 he was posted to the 13th Training Battalion, Tidworth, England, returning to the 16th in time for the offensive of 8 August.
Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, on 23 August McCarthy performed what the official war historian rated as 'perhaps the most effective feat of individual fighting in the history of the A.I.F., next to Jacka's at PoziÃ¿Â¨res'. The 16th Battalion, with McCarthy commanding 'D' Company, had attained its objectives but the battalion on the left was unable to make headway. Accompanied by Sergeant F. J. Robbins, D.C.M., M.M., McCarthy attacked the German machine-gun posts which were preventing its advance. They raced into the enemy trench system, shooting and bombing as they went, destroying three machine-gun positions. When his mate fell wounded, McCarthy pressed on, picking up German bombs as he continued to fight down the trench 'inflicting heavy casualties'. Coming upon another enemy pocket, he shot two officers and bombed the post until a blood-stained handkerchief signalled the surrender of the forty occupants.
This feat of bravery, which resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross, had an extraordinary conclusion. As the battalion historian records, 'the prisoners closed in on him from all sides ... and patted him on the back!' In twenty minutes he had killed twenty Germans, taken fifty prisoners and seized 500 yards (460 m) of the German front. This jovial hero believed that there was 'a V.C. in everybody if given a chance'.
On 21 November 1918 McCarthy was again evacuated, ill, to England. He returned home on 20 December 1919 and his A.I.F. appointment ended on 6 August 1920. In England, on 25 January 1919, he had married Florence (Flossie) Minnie Norville, at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Their only child Lawrence Norville was killed in action on Bougainville in 1945.
'Mac' moved from Western Australia to Victoria in 1926 where he joined the staff of the Sunshine Harvester Works. He remained with the company, mostly as a traveller in the Mallee, until the Depression forced staff reductions in 1934. From 1935 until his retirement in 1969 he was superintendent of the Trustees, Executors & Agency Co. Ltd building, Melbourne.
He attended the V.C. centenary celebrations in London in 1956 and was present at the opening of V.C. Corner at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, in 1964. A most popular, generous and unassuming man, he took a keen interest in community affairs.

Educated locally, he took up blacksmithing and served his time at this trade. He was an excellent horseman, an expert marksman, a competent bushman and an amateur boxer.

Illness prevented him from enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force until 31 August 1915 when he was posted to the 12th Reinforcements to the 15th Battalion. In Egypt, on 3 March 1916, he was drafted into the 47th Battalion and embarked for France in June. The battalion fought at PoziÃ¿Â¨res Heights in August and in the battles of Messines and Broodseinde in 1917. Appointed lance corporal on 5 May 1917, McDougall was promoted corporal in September; he became temporary sergeant in November and was confirmed in that rank next January.

McDougall was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Dernancourt on 28 March 1918. He was on watch at a post on the 47th's right flank when he heard Germans approaching. When a Lewis-gun team was knocked out by an enemy bomb McDougall snatched up the gun, attacked two machine-gun teams and killed their crews. He turned one of the captured machine-guns on the enemy, killing several and routing one wave of their attack. Meanwhile about fifty Germans had crossed a section of railway which the Australians had held. McDougall turned his gun on them and when his ammunition was spent he seized a bayonet and charged, killing four men. He then used a Lewis-gun, killing many Germans and forcing the surrender of the remaining thirty-three.

Eight days later, in the same location, McDougall won the Military Medal. During a heavy enemy attack he got a gun into position and enfiladed the Germans at close quarters. When the gun was hit he crawled some 300 yards (275 m) under fire to get a replacement; he then took command of the leaderless platoon for the rest of the action. He was posted to the 48th Battalion on 28 May. At Windsor Castle on 19 August he was invested with the Victoria Cross by King George V and shortly afterwards returned to Australia where he was discharged from the A.I.F. on 15 December 1918.

McDougall entered the Tasmanian Forestry Department and in the early 1930s became an inspector in charge of forests in the north-western part of the State. He several times performed outstanding organizational and rescue work during bushfires. He was living at Scottsdale before visiting London for the V.C. centenary in 1956. McDougall died on 7 July 1968 at Scottsdale, survived by his wife Martha, nÃ¿Â©e Anderson-Harrison, whom he had married in 1926; they had no issue.",,,Yes,,,,Website,J. G.

The Battalion proceeded overseas to France in December. In early 1917, the German Army withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, allowing the British front to be advanced. The Germans, however, made selected stands to delay this advance and the 28th Battalion was involved in defeating a counter-attack at Beaumetz on 23 March. Stanley was charged with disobedience of orders on 24 July 1917 when he ate his emergency ration without authority and was awarded 2 days loss of pay. The only large battle in 1917 in which the 29th Battalion played a major role was Polygon Wood, fought in the Ypres sector in Belgium on 26 September. In January 1918 Stanley returned to England on leave and while there became ill spending the next five months in and out of hospital re-joining his unit in France in June. On 27 July while in the trenches at Le Treport he was wounded in action with a gunshot wound which fractured his right forearm and consequently Stanley was transported back to England for treatment. By the time he recovered the war was over. Stanley arrived back in Australia on 30 April 1919. He returned home to Kate living in Belmont and obtained work as a labourer. They had a daughter in 1922
and moved to Whittington shortly after. There were a couple more moves for the family - to Corio, Geelong West and Belmont as Stanley tried other occupations such as basil worker and wool worker. He died in 1966.

McGee left for posterity virtually no record of his pre-war days. He married Eileen Rose Bailey at Avoca on 15 November 1914. When he enlisted in the 40th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, on 1 March 1916 he was living at Avoca and was employed by the Tasmanian Department of Railways as an engine driver.

The 40th Battalion, known as the 'Fighting Fortieth', was raised as a Tasmanian unit, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel J. E. C. Lord, to encourage recruitment in that State. Soldiers attached to it were trained at the Claremont military camp near Hobart before sailing for England and eventually the French-Belgian border, which they reached on 24 November 1916. McGee quickly developed a reputation as a reliable and fearless soldier. He had been promoted lance corporal only twenty-two days after enlistment and on 4 December, when the battalion was operating near ArmentiÃ¿Â¨res, he rose to corporal; on 12 January 1917 he was promoted sergeant.

The 40th Battalion took part in the battle of Messines in June after which it joined in the 3rd battle of Ypres. From September conditions were appalling with soldiers battling in a 'sea of mud and water'. On 4 October the battalion was engaged in the attack on Broodseinde Ridge. McGee's platoon was 'suffering severely' from machine-gun fire coming from a German pill-box. Single-handed, McGee rushed the post across open ground armed only with a revolver and, descending upon the garrison, shot some of its crew and captured the rest. His action enabled the advance to proceed. Afterwards he reorganized the remains of his platoon and was 'foremost' in the rest of the advance. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his 'coolness and bravery', but the decoration was posthumous for on 12 October he had been killed in the fighting at Passchendaele. He was buried there in Tyne Cot cemetery.

McGee had been 'respected by all'. However his comrades and family were not the only ones to suffer from his loss. The Launceston Examiner commented that his death marked the fourteenth young man from Avoca who had paid 'the supreme sacrifice' which was a 'heavy toll' for a small community. McGee was survived by his wife and a daughter; in 1929 Eileen remarried but remained in Avoca.

Rawdon was educated at Dubbo High School and worked as a jackeroo on Leewong, a station at Yarrabandi, near Parkes, managed by his father. Nicknamed 'Ron', he was a keen cricketer and footballer, despite being slightly built. He was a good-looking young man, very quiet and a little moody, with a strong 'streak of honest determination'.
On 14 October 1940 Middleton enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force under the Empire Air Training Scheme. He learned to fly at Narromine and received further instruction in Canada. Arriving in Britain in September 1941, he was promoted flight sergeant in December and posted to No.149 Squadron, Royal Air Force, in February 1942. After gaining experience as second pilot in Stirling bombers, he became first pilot and captain in July. Next month he was posted to No.7 Squadron, R.A.F. He returned to No.149 in September.

By 28 November 1942 Middleton had completed twenty-eight operational flights. Three of his crew had already flown their quota of thirty and could have left, but decided to stay through loyalty to Middleton. Their sortie that night was to Turin, Italy. Over the target they were hit by flak. One shell exploded in the cockpit wounding Middleton. His right eye was destroyed and the bone above it exposed; he was probably also wounded in the body and legs.

With his aeroplane severely damaged, Middleton rejected the options of flying to Africa or bailing out over German-occupied France and insisted on returning to England for the sake of the crew. The flight lasted more than four hours, during which he was in constant agony. He could barely see and suffered further pain when he spoke. On reaching the English coast, he flew over land so that his comrades could parachute safely. Five of them reached the ground and survived. He then turned back towards the English Channel to avoid crashing in a populated area. Two of the crew remained with their captain, parachuted into the sea and drowned. Middleton was too weak to leave the Stirling which crashed into the sea on the morning of 29 November 1942, killing him. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross and promoted pilot officer (with effect from 15 November).
Middleton's body was washed ashore at Shakespeare Beach, Dover, in February 1943 and buried in St John's churchyard, Beck Row, Suffolk, with full air force honours. He was 26 and unmarried. He had won the first V.C. awarded to a member of the R.A.A.F. in World War II. His father said, 'My son did his duty'. In 1978 Middleton's V.C. was presented to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, which holds his portraits, painted by Harold Freedman and Norman Carter after his death.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Leigh Edmonds,,,,2000.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Middleton, Rawdon Hume (1916-1942)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/middleton-rawdon-hume-11118,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8897943 -36.1394207)

Her husband James Bickford Moysey, who is thought to be the first white settler in Beaumaris, and his wife Susannah board the 'Sea Queen' and arrived in Port Philip in 1844. It is recorded that in Sept 1892, Mrs Susannh Moysey, a devout Christian, who had for many years cherished the dream of a church in Dandenong, was forced due to failing health, to give up her weekly trips to Berwick where she had been meeting with fellow Christians. With the help of members of her family, she visited and brought together local people for a Sunday communion service held in the old Salvation Army citadel on the corner of Walker and Langhorne Streets until it was burnt down in 1895 (the year of Susannah's death). Her efforts and those of her family strengthened the Dandenong Church of Christ congregation and lead to construction of the weatherboard church located on the south west corner of George and Robinson Street in 1904. The Church of Christ opened on 29th August after an 11 week construction period undertaken by builder David Brown for the cost of 500 pounds. In early 1918, through voluntary labour, the Sunday School was added to the rear of the church at a cost of 140 pounds. Susannah Moysey's son, George Bickford Moysey, was the first Victorian-born evangelist in the Churches of Christ denomination.

In 1861 the Hamilton Borough Council arranged for it to be formally gazetted as Mt Baimbridge Road.

Born Meredith, enlisted Geelong.
Percy, a labourer from Torquay enlisted at Geelong just a few weeks after he turned 21 in August 1915. He was initially attached to the 23rd Battalion and embarked with them at Melbourne aboard HMAT Ulysses on 27 July 1915. While training in Egypt he was transferred to the 58th Battalion in February 1916 before they embarked for France in June.
Not long after arriving in France, the 58th became embroiled in its first major battle on the Western Front at Fromelles on 19 July. The battle was a disaster. The 58th had the dual role of providing carrying parties and a reserve force. The reserve force (approximately half of the battalion) was ordered to attack late in the battle and was virtually annihilated by machine-gun fire; as a whole, the 58th suffered casualties equal to almost a third of its strength. Despite the grievous losses in its battalions, the 5th Division continued to man the front in the Fromelles sector for a further two months.
Early in 1917 the 58th battalion participated in the advance that followed the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, but it was spared from the assault. It did, however, defend gains made during the second battle of Bullecourt, between 9 and 12 May. Later in the year, the AIF's focus of operations switched to the Ypres sector in Belgium. The 58th's major battle here was at Polygon Wood on 26 September.
With the collapse of Russia in October 1917, a major German offensive on the Western Front was expected in early 1918. This came in late March and the 5th Division moved to defend the sector around Corbie; the 58th Battalion was the 15th Brigade's reserve during its now legendary counter-attack at Villers-Bretonneux on 25 April. When the Allies launched their own offensive around Amiens on 8 August, the 58th Battalion was amongst the units in action, although its role in the subsequent advance was limited. The battalion was involved in the fighting to secure Peronne at the beginning of September and entered its last major battle of the war on 29 September 1918.

Newland embarked as a private in the 4th Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse, for service in the South African War on 26 March 1903. His unit arrived at Durban shortly before the peace treaty was signed and was soon back in Australia. He served with the Royal Australian Artillery in Victoria from 1903-1907 and was a policeman in Tasmania from 1909-1910 when he rejoined the regular army there. He served with the Australian Instructional Corps until enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in August 1914 as regimental quartermaster sergeant, 12th Battalion. In December 1913, at Sheffield, Tasmania, he had married Florence May Mitchell.

Newland embarked for Egypt and landed at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 where he was wounded (probably on that day) and evacuated. He was promoted through the ranks in 1915 and 1916. He sailed for France in March as a Captain and took command of A Company in August. On 21 August, during the battle of the Somme, he led his company in a successful attack on trenches north-east of Mouquet Farm. He was recommended for the Military Cross but was mentioned in despatches. Late in February 1917 the Australians followed the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg line but found strong enemy posts at Le Barque. Newland led his company in the attack on the town on 27 February but was evacuated wounded. The advance continued and Newland rejoined the battalion in time to lead his company on 8 April in the attack on Boursies. Under heavy fire he led a bombing attack against a strong-point and secured the outskirts of the village. The Germans kept a sharp fire on the position during the day and after dusk counter-attacked, driving back most of the advanced posts. Newland, assisted by Sergeant J. W. Whittle and reinforcements, charged the Germans and regained the lost ground.

On 15 April a major German counter-attack was launched against the 1st Australian Division. Newland's company was south-east of Lagnicourt and held the Germans until outflanked. Forced back, the company made a stand at a sunken road where, despite repeated attacks, they held the position until reinforcements arrived. Newland's tenacity and disregard for his own safety while encouraging his men at Lagnicourt, as well as his courage in both the attack and counter-attack at Boursies, were recognized by award of the Victoria Cross. On 5 May, during the 2nd battle of Bullecourt, he was wounded for the third time and evacuated to England; his A.I.F. appointment ended in Victoria on 2 March 1918. He carried out full-time duty as a captain (Reserve of Officers) until 31 December 1921. 
Newland's wife died of tuberculosis in 1924 and in April 1925, at Bendigo, he married Heather Vivienne Broughton. Newland was promoted quartermaster and honorary major in 1930 and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1935. He retired from the army in 1941 and from April to September was deputy commissioner of the Northern Territory division of the Australian Red Cross Society. On 2 January 1942 he joined the inspection staff at Ammunition Factory, Footscray, Melbourne. Survived by his wife and their daughter, he died suddenly of heart failure at Caulfield on 19 March 1949 and was buried in Brighton cemetery.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Anthony Staunton ,,,,1988.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Newland, James Ernest (1881-1949)","Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/newland-james-ernest-7827,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8894305 -36.1443831)

After surviving intact the wind changed and she parted her anchor and was driven ashore near the lighthouse. Even then the ""Olivia Davis"" was largely unscathed and it was hoped she could be quickly refloated. However, two weeks later severe storms battered the coast holing the hull of the ""Olivia Davis"" and destroying any hopes of salvaging the cargo.

The ""Olivia Davis"" was built in 1854 in Greensboro USA by Satterfield-Moore for John G. Davis (1808-1891) who was a merchant and manufacturer in Philadelphia. His company ""Union Spoke Works"" manufactured spokes, rims and plow handles. He also owned sailing vessels. The ""Olivia Davis"" was named for his wife Olivia Fitler Davis (1816-1897).

He arrived in Western Australia as a youth, having worked his passage as a stoker.
Giving his occupation as sleeper-hewer, he joined the Australian Imperial Force in Perth on 19 August 1915 and left Australia with the 12th Reinforcements for the 16th Battalion in December. After training in Egypt in early 1916 the battalion moved to the Western Front in France where it fought on the Somme. On 9-12 August the 16th mounted an attack on German positions at Mouquet Farm near PoziÃ¿Â¨res. Devastating German artillery fire caused heavy casualties, an entry in the battalion war diary on 12 August stating laconically that 'the trench as a trench had ceased to exist'.
During this period O'Meara, then acting as a stretcher-bearer, behaved in a manner which led one officer to describe him as 'the most fearless and gallant soldier I have ever seen'. He was credited with having saved the lives of over twenty-five wounded men by carrying them in from no man's land 'under conditions that are undescribable'. Even after the battalion was relieved its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E. Drake-Brockman, saw O'Meara returning to the front line through the bombardment to rescue two wounded comrades despite having himself 'reached a position of comparative safety'. At other times he had, on his own initiative, brought up much-needed supplies of grenades, ammunition and food. For these actions O'Meara was awarded the Victoria Cross.
O'Meara spent the rest of the war with the 16th Battalion; he was wounded three times and promoted sergeant. In November 1918 he returned to Australia and was discharged from the A.I.F. in Perth in November 1919. His war experiences caused a complete breakdown in his health for he spent the rest of his life in military hospitals, suffering from chronic mania. He was too ill to attend a special Armistice Day dinner in 1929 given by the governor of Western Australia for the State's V.C. winners. He died in Claremont Mental Hospital, Perth, on 20 December 1935. His death certificate gave his occupation as 'returned soldier'. He was buried with full military honours in Karrakatta Catholic cemetery by Fr John Fahey. 
In 1917 O'Meara had revisited his native Ireland where money was raised as a testimonial to him from Lorrha and neighbouring parishes; he left it to the parish for restoring historic Lorrha Abbey. That task being beyond this sum, it was instead applied to repairs of the existing parish church. In 1986 his V.C. was donated to the West Australian Army Museum.
Little is known about O'Meara personally but one officer of the 16th described him at Mouquet Farm as 'always cheerful and optimistic', willing 'to volunteer for any job'.

Frank left Tewinga Public School at the age of 13 and worked on the family farm-dairying and growing bananas at Upper Newee Creek, near Macksville. While serving in the Volunteer Defence Corps, he was called up for full-time duty in the Australian Military Forces on 26 March 1943. He was posted to the 8th Battalion, a Militia unit which moved to Lae, New Guinea, in May 1944 and to Emirau Island in September.

From June 1945 the 8th Battalion operated in northern Bougainville, containing Japanese forces on the Bonis Peninsula. On 24 July Partridge was a member of a patrol ordered to destroy an enemy post, known as Base 5, near Ratsua. The Australians came under heavy machine-gun fire. Despite wounds to his arm and thigh, Partridge rushed the nearest bunker, killing its occupants with grenade and knife, then began to attack a second bunker until loss of blood forced him to stop. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Of the Australians who won the V.C. in World War II, he was the youngest and the last, and the only militiaman. After visiting London in 1946 for the Victory march, he was discharged from the A.M.F. on 17 October in New South Wales; he was again to travel to England in 1953 for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and in 1956 for the Victoria Cross centenary celebrations.

Returning to Upper Newee Creek, Partridge lived with his father in a dirt-floored farmhouse. He devoted himself to self-education, reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica by kerosene lamp and developing an extraordinarily retentive memory. In 1962-63 he appeared as a contestant on the television quiz show, 'Pick-a-Box', compered by Bob Dyer; his laconic manner appealed strongly to viewers. Partridge was one of only three contestants to win all forty boxes; his prizes were valued at more than Ã¿Â£12,000. At St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, on 23 February 1963 he married Barbara Mavis Vyvienne Jenniffer Wylie Dunlop, a 31-year-old nursing sister who lived at Turramurra. The wedding received extensive media coverage. Barbara remained at Turramurra while Frank built a new home at the farm. He drove to Sydney every weekend to see her.

Partridge was an honorary member of the Returned Sailors', Soldiers' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, a life member and patron of the Macksville Ex-Servicemen's Club, and vice-president of the Nambucca district council of the Banana Growers' Federation Co-operative Ltd. Harbouring deep political ambitions, he confidently sought Country Party pre-selection for the House of Representatives seat of Cowper in 1963. His views were regarded as rather extreme, and he lost to Ian Robinson. Partridge agreed to be Robinson's campaign-manager for the election that year. To supplement the income from his farm, Partridge travelled around the district selling life assurance. He was killed in a motorcar accident on 23 March 1964 near Bellingen and was buried with full military honours in Macksville cemetery. His wife and three-month-old son survived him.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Barry O.

On the way he came across a body of some 300 enemy and four field guns. He immediately called on them to surrender, which they did, after first refusing. By his prompt and effective action he undoubtedly contributed a great deal towards the success of the operation round this town'. He was invalided to Australia from Egypt with recurrent malaria on New Years Day, 1919. He embarked on the Aeneas and was medically discharged on 2 August 1919.

Educated at Ingham state school and then apprenticed as a cabinetmaker. In August 1951 enlisted in the regular army, after a short period with 31st Infantry Battalion CMF, and was posted to the 1st Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment in September 1952.  He served in Korea with the 1st Battalion from April 1952 until March 1953, then the 28th British Commonwealth Infantry Brigade Defence and Employment Platoon, and returned to Queensland in September where he married Florence Catherine Plaw, in 1954. In the 1960s he served in Malaya, Papua New Guinea and Brisbane. Appointed to the Training Team in Vietnam in February 1969. Payne soon joined a mobile strike force battalion which was reconnoitring enemy infiltration routes from Laos into Vietnam. Once the routes were located they were interdicted in an attempt to relieve the pressure on the recently constructed and occupied Ben Het Special Forces camp.On 24 May (nearly two weeks after Ray Simpson won the Victoria Cross) Payne was commanding the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion when the battalion was attacked by a numerically superior North Vietnamese force.  The two forward companies were heavily attacked with rockets, mortars and machine-guns from three directions simultaneously.  The indigenous soldiers faltered so Payne rushed about firing his Armalite rifle and hurling grenaded to keep the enemy at bay while he tried to rally the soldiers. In doing so he was wounded in the hands, upper arm and hip by four pieces of rocket shrapnel and one piece of mortar shrapnel. The battalion commander decided to fight his way back to base and this movement commenced by the only available route.  With a few remnants of his company, which had suffered heavy casualties, Payne covered the withdrawal with grenades and gunfire and then attempted to round up more of his company.  By nightfall he had succeeded in gathering a composite party of his own and another company and had established a small defensive perimeter. about 350 metres north-east of the hill.  the enemy by now had captured the former hill-top position. In darkness Payne set off to locate those who had been cut off and disoriented. At 9 p.m. (2100hrs) he crawled over to one displaced group, having tracked them by the fluorescence of their footsteps in rotting vegetable matter on the ground, and thus began a 800 metre traverse of the area for the next three hours.  The enemy were moving about and firing, but Payne was able to locate some forty men, some wounded, some of whom Payne personally dragged out. He organised others who were not wounded to crawl out on their stomachs with wounded on their backs. Once he concentrated his party he navigated them back to the temporary perimeter only to find the position abandoned by troops who had moved back to the battalion base.  Undeterred he led his party, as well as another group of wounded encountered enroute, back to the battalion base where they arrived at about 3 a.m.(0300hrs). Evacuated from Vietnam for medical reasons in September 1969, Payne received a warm public welcome at Brisbane before entering an army hospital for treatment. On his recovery he was posted as an instructor at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, remaining until he joined the 42nd Battalion, the Royal Queensland Regiment, on 20 December 1972. He had been presented with his Victoria Cross by the Queen aboard Britannia, at Brisbane, on 13 April 1970. The United States recommended the award of the Silver Star and later the Distinguished Service Cross while the Republic of Vietnam honoured him with its Cross of Gallantry With Bronze Star.

His education is not recorded but he worked on his parents' orchard at Barker's Creek, then at Thompson's Foundry, Castlemaine, and in the Leongatha district. He married Emma Hewitt, on 10 July 1907 at the Congregational parsonage, Castlemaine.  They had five children but although they separated in the early 1920s they were never divorced and she predeceased him in 1964.

Peeler enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 17 February 1916 and embarked with the machine-gun section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in June; he was promoted lance corporal on 6 November in France and was slightly wounded by shell-fire during the battle of Messines on 7 June 1917. Peeler was one of twenty-four Lewis-gunners of the 3rd Pioneers who were attached for anti-aircraft duties to the 37th Battalion for the assault on 4 October on Broodseinde Ridge, Belgium. He joined in the first wave, leading an attack against three enemy posts which were sniping the advancing Australians and then turned on a machine-gun post. He accounted for thirty of the enemy and for his fearlessness and fine example was awarded the Victoria Cross. Peeler remarked in 1966: 'I never saw the faces of those I killed. They were just men in an enemy uniform. It was simply them or me'. Exploitation of the Australian success that day was hampered by heavy rain. The 3rd Pioneers next attacked in shocking conditions on 12 October in the 2nd battle of Passchendaele; Peeler was wounded in the right arm. While recuperating he received his Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 8 January 1918. He returned to his unit on 17 May and was promoted corporal two weeks later and sergeant on 30 July. Peeler arrived back in Australia on 11 October and was discharged on 10 December. He worked with the Victorian Department of Lands for six years and then took up an orchard, but returned to Melbourne to work on the staff of the Sunshine Harvester Works. He was appointed custodian of Victoria's Shrine of Remembrance in 1934.

During World War II Peeler, understating his age by fourteen years, enlisted in the 2nd A.I.F. in 1940 and saw service in the Syrian campaign as company quartermaster sergeant of 'D' Company, 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion. In June 1941 he led a patrol to recover four Australian wounded. His battalion was part of a small Australian force hastily landed in Java in February 1942 to assist the Dutch against the rapid Japanese advance; after the island's surrender to the Japanese he survived a long period on the Burma Railway. He was one of only three World War I V.C. winners then serving overseas, the others being Walter Brown and Arthur Blackburn. He returned to Australia in October 1945 to learn that his son Donald had been killed on Bougainville in December 1944 while serving with the 15th Battalion.

Wally Peeler resumed duty as custodian of the Shrine of Remembrance and was an early member of the Victorian Corps of Commissionaires. He was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1961 and retired in 1964.  From the early 1920s he lived with Kathleen Emma Peeler and they had four children.  Survived by two of his children from his first marriage and by Kathleen (d.1969) and three of their children, he died at South Caulfield on 23 May 1968 and was buried in Brighton cemetery.

He was educated at Navestock, Essex, and after migrating to Canada was employed by the Canadian Pacific Railways. In 1906 he returned to London, joined the Metropolitan Police Force, Chelsea division, and on 13 December, at St Luke's Anglican Church, Chelsea, married Edith Mary Smith; they had a son and a daughter. Pope resigned from the police in 1910 and migrated to Australia where he was employed as a furniture salesman with Blain & Co., Beaufort Street, Perth. He then worked on the staff of the Temperance & General Insurance Co., Perth. Before leaving England he had married, and his wife Edith Mary and their son and daughter had accompanied him to Australia.

Pope enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 25 August 1915 and on 10 February 1916 was commissioned second lieutenant from the rank of sergeant in the 11th Battalion (18th Reinforcements). On 15 July he embarked at Fremantle in the transport Ajana and reached England in September. On 10 December he joined the 11th Battalion in France and on 26 December was promoted lieutenant.

On 15 April 1917 Pope was killed in action at Louverval and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. He had been placed in command of a picquet post in the sector held by his battalion, his orders being to hold this post at all costs. The post was attacked and surrounded by Germans. Pope, finding that he was running short of ammunition, sent back to headquarters for supplies but the ammunition party could not get through. In the hope of holding his position Pope ordered his men to charge a large enemy force and they were overpowered.

He attended Christ Church but did not complete his education. During WW1, he first served as a dispatch rider in the motorcycle section of Royal Engineers on the western front; later in the war he was given command of all riders in the 1st Corps Headquarters Signals Company. In 1915, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and in 1918 he became an officer in the new Royal Air Force, commanding the Number 7 Squadron. In 1934, he led British forces in Aden, relying heavily on air power to subdue local insurrections. He was promoted to the rank of air commodore in 1935 then air vice-marshal in 1937.

Before the start of World War II, he became the commander-in-chief of the RAF Bomber Command. In that position, he advocated strategic area bombing against cities of German industrial regions instead of targeting specific factories; this was a decision that sometimes believed to be a precursor to the German Luftwaffe's retaliatory bombings on London. In Oct 1940, after being knighted, he was appointed the Chief of the Air Staff with the rank of air chief marshal. With bomber units of both Britain and the United States under his command (excluding the duration of Operation Overlord in Normandy), he continued to improve the efficiency of bombing against German cities in industrial regions. In 1944, he was promoted to the Marshal of the Royal Air Force. Near the end of the war, he thought bombing should play a support role to the Allied offensive, but Arthur Harris, his head of Bomber Command, overruled him, arguing continued carpet bombing continued to be a critical component of the overall strategy.

Portal retired from the RAF shortly after the war's end. He was made a Baron in August 1945, then a Viscount in 1946. Between 1946 and 1951, he was the Controller of Atomic Energy. Between 1958 and 1959, he joined the civilian workforce as the Chairman of British Aluminium; two years later he was elected the chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation.

William Henry Pryor (1849-1924) and John Pryor (1863-1933) were brothers from a large family of early Malvern pioneers who in 1886 purchased 64 and 66 McArthur (formerly Orchard) Street. Both brothers worked as gardeners for the Malvern Council for over 30 years. William was a Trustee of the Spring Road Methodist Church and both William
and John taught at the Sunday School. William and Jane Pryor had 14 children, of whom 7 survived infancy. The family lived at 64 McArthur Street for about 30 years. For more than 40 years John and his large family lived next door at 66 McArthur Street. The children of both families attended the Spring Road State School No. 1604. William and Jane's youngest son, George, was killed in action in 1916 during the Great War. His name appears on the Malvern War Memorial now located in Central Park. Both George Pryor and Charles Pryor, John's son, are listed on the W.W. I Honour Roll at Spring Road Church. Various members of the Pryor family continued to live in Malvern until the early 1950s. During the 1960s L.J. Pryor, grandson of William Henry Pryor, was Principal of the Toorak Teachers College located at Stonington in Glenferrie Road. The Pryors have had a close relationship with Malvern for over 100 years.

Rogers was educated locally at public schools. In 1886 his family moved to Heywood, Victoria, where he later worked on his father's farm and joined the local company of the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1898. He was 188 cm tall, 76 kg and a superb horseman, tough bushman and crack rifle-shot.

When the South African War broke out Rogers enlisted and in November 1899 disembarked at Cape Town as a private, 1st Victorian Mounted Infantry Company. On 1 May 1900 he was seconded as a corporal to the Provincial Mounted Police, Orange River Colony. Instead of returning home with the Victorian Contingent in November he joined the South African Constabulary as a sergeant. In June 1901 he was part of its No.6 Troop, commanded by Lieutenant Frank Dickinson. The troop joined a 200-man column of the Royal Irish Rifles which patrolled from Thaba'Nchu to Tabaksberg in search of Boer forces. On the return march, about 16 km north of Hout Nek, the column came under Boer sniper fire. Dickinson with six men, including Rogers, waited in ambush at a kraal while the column returned to camp. They surprised the Boers and then Dickinson withdrew his men to rejoin the column. About two miles from it sixty Boers tried to cut them off. When Dickinson's horse was shot Rogers, despite heavy enemy fire, rode back, pulled him up behind him on his horse and carried him out of danger. Rogers returned twice more to rescue two men who had let go of their horses when they had dismounted to fire. He then caught and led back to the firing line two horses which had escaped from other men. He returned to Australia late in 1901 and Dickinson recommended that his gallantry be recognized; Rogers was awarded the Victoria Cross on 18 April 1902, having previously been mentioned in dispatches.

A month later he again left for South Africa as a lieutenant with the 6th Battalion, Australian Commonwealth Horse. However, the war had ended and the battalion returned home. Rogers tried to obtain a commission in the Australian Military Forces but was unsuccessful. After buying and then selling a farm at Yea, Victoria, he returned to South Africa where he served as a special detective with the Cape Police until February 1904. On 25 April 1907, describing himself as a mounted trooper, he married Ethel Maud Seldon at Portland, Victoria; they had two sons. By 1912 Rogers was a marker at Williamstown rifle range and by the outbreak of World War I he was an assistant ranger there. On 6 December 1914 he was commissioned in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade Train, Australian Army Service Corps, Australian Imperial Force. He was seriously wounded at Gallipoli on 4 August 1915 and evacuated to Egypt. He then served with the Anzac Provost Corps before returning to Australia on 18 July 1916.

Rogers resumed work at Williamstown as a range assistant, then in 1921 became an assistant storeman, Ordnance Branch, A.M.F., Victoria. He resigned in 1922 and resumed farming. He lived at Kew, Melbourne, for over thirty years; then, after his wife died, with his one surviving son at Roseville, Sydney. He died in Concord Repatriation Hospital on 28 October 1961, and was cremated with military honours in Melbourne. His name is commemorated on a memorial cairn at Heywood.

Born Torquay, enlisted in Torquay. Named on honour boards - Puebla, Barrabool and South Barwon Shires and the Torquay Improvement Association.
Harold was a labourer from Geelong, possibly working at Ballarat where he enlisted prior signing up on 21 January 1916. He was initially attached to the 19th Training Depot at Ballarat before transferring to Broadmeadows and the 29th Battalion, 6th Reinforcements. Harold embarked with the 6th Reinforcements from Melbourne on HMAT Euripides on 4 April 1916 disembarking Suez, 12 May before heading across to England in June spending time with the 8th Training Battalion.
In September he joined the 29th Battalion in France and was wounded in action in November with a gunshot wound to the hand and knee consequently evacuated to England with those injuries and trench feet in December. Harold appeared not to be one to keep family and friends at home up to date about his health. From London in September Harold sent a letter home in response to an instruction from a superior officer. ""I got rather a surprise today to receive word from you as to someone enquiring news of me. I have had late mail from Australia and my people had received my letters up to date. As regards to how I am getting on: I left France last November 25 and at present stationed at the above address and enjoying the best of health. Thanks for the trouble you have taken to find me"". Following his recovery, he transferred to the 65th Battalion in England before re-joining the 29th Battalion overseas in October 1917.
During 1918, the 29th fought in a minor attack at Morlancourt on 29 July, and then during the Allied Hundred Days Offensive that was launched on 8 August 1918, the battalion took part in the 8th Brigade's advance up the treacherous Morcourt Valley, subsequently achieving a considerable feat by capturing the town of Vauvillers. Harold's unit had reached their objective North of Harbonnieres and were holding position. The next day at 11:42 am the battalion moved forward to attack from the left of Harbonnieres under heavy machine gun fire. No other troops were moving on the right flank leaving the battalion open to heavy fire.
Tanks that were supposed to support them had been put out of action early in the advance. There were heavy casualties being caused by machine guns firing from in and around Vauvillers. An order arrived to stay in position until it was possible to move without heavy casualties. The Coys marched by short rushes towards the objective and engaged the enemy machine guns with Lewis Gun and rifle fire. After a series of short rushes of crawling they achieved the objective, though one company had advanced through and beyond Vauvillers succeed to establish Lewis Gun Posts to cover the village. The new front line was established as a series of posts. The Commanding Officer noted in his diary that ""Great bravery was
exhibited by all ranks in advancing against extremely heavy enemy M.G. fire and ultimately silencing all opposition."" 
AWM 29th Battalion War Diary 9/8/18 On this day 3 officers and 14 other ranks were killed from the battalion. After the morning advance, Harold a stretcher bearer approached some men who were with some German Prisoners thinking there was a wounded man amongst them. He was wounded at first by a piece of shell in the arm and while he was being attended to another piece of shell hit him in the back and came out the front cutting a piece off his pay book which he had in his pocket. He and many of the prisoners died instantly. He was initially buried three-quarters of a mile North East of Harbonnieres, on the left of road to Rainecourt. A Chaplain officiated at his burial.

He was born on 20 October 1920 in Bristol as the eldest of seven children to a vicar. His education was cut short by the early death of his father, resulting in him taking a job with Imperial Tobacco. 

He joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1938 and joined 221 Squadron after pilot training. In early 1942 Rothwell was transferred from Iceland to the Special Duties Wellington flight based on Malta. The Special Duties group flew with the Royal Navy to locate enemy convoys, and bring in ships of aircraft, dropping flares, observing results and also bombing themselves. He was billeted to a former leper colony, and after the billets were destroyed the squadron moved to the seaplane base at Lalafrana. From Malta, Rothwell and his colleagues attacked Axis convoys and airfields. After the accommodation at Lalafrana was again destroyed, they were forced to live in nearby caves, where they had to endure vicious sand bugs. 

Rothwell later returned to the UK where he undertook instructing and then moved to a Halifax flying meteorological squadron. On demobilisation, he had flown 158 operational sorties. In retirement he was an active member of the George Cross Island Association and undertook annual pilgrimages to Malta each April. He died on 20 December 2010.

He was educated at the Vere Street State School, Collingwood, and became a mechanical engineer.
Ruthven was employed in the timber industry when he enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 16 April 1915. He left Australia in August with reinforcements for the 22nd Battalion which he joined in October on Gallipoli. Late in March 1916 the 22nd went to France. On 17 April, during his first tour of duty in the forward area near Fleurbaix, Ruthven was wounded. He rejoined his battalion in August on the Somme and was promoted lance corporal. On 26 January 1917 he was confirmed in the rank of sergeant.
On 19 May 1918 Ruthven took part in an attack near Ville-sur-Ancre. When his company commander was wounded, Ruthven assumed command but soon the advance was held up by heavy machine-gun fire. Unhesitating, he ran at the machine-gun post, bombed it, bayoneted one of the crew and captured the gun. Then, encountering enemy coming out of a shelter, he wounded two and captured six. Having reorganized his men and formed a post, he noticed further enemy movement in a nearby sunken road. Armed only with a revolver, he shot two men and captured thirty-two. He spent the rest of the day, under fire, supervising consolidation and encouraging his men. He was awarded the Victoria Cross.
On 11 June near Mericourt Ruthven was wounded again, and on 1 July was commissioned second lieutenant. He returned to Australia in October with several other Victoria Cross winners to assist recruiting and received a hero's welcome in Melbourne. He was promoted lieutenant and on 11 December his A.I.F. appointment ended.
Ruthven resumed work as a wood machinist and on 20 December 1919 married Irene May White at St Philip's Anglican Church, Abbotsford; they had a daughter and a son. In the mid-1920s the family moved to a soldier-settlement block at Werrimull. Bad seasons and poor health forced Ruthven back to Collingwood in 1931. He became a carrier and later worked with the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission. He was elected to the Collingwood Council and became mayor in 1945.
During World War II, from December 1941 Ruthven served with the 3rd Australian Garrison Battalion and other garrison units, including those centred at Murchison, Victoria's largest prisoner-of-war camp. In August 1944 he ceased full-time duty, as major. He sat in the Victorian Legislative Assembly during 1945-55 as the Labor member for Preston, then following a redistribution represented Reservoir until his retirement in 1961.
He retained close links with other Victoria Cross winners and the Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia. In 1932 he was one of the pallbearers at Albert Jacka's funeral and he attended the 1956 Victoria Cross centenary celebrations in London. He was president of the Werrimull and Collingwood R.S.S.I.L.A. sub-branches, a life member of the Preston sub-branch and a trustee of Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance and the St Kilda Memorial Hall. Ruthven was also official timekeeper for the Collingwood Football Club and a foundation member of its social club. The war, however, had severely affected his health; illness forced his retirement from politics.
Survived by his wife and children, he died on 12 January 1970 in Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital and was cremated with military honours.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Matthew Higgins,,,,1988.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Ruthven, William (1893-1970)","Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University",http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/ruthven-william-8306,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8977941 -36.144241)

Born in Ireland, he came to Australia in 1829, purchased the Rutledge Survey of 5120 acres in 1843 and entered politics for the Western District seat of Villiers and Heytesbury 1851-61. Became a magistrate in 1844. From 1868 to 1873 he was a member of the Shire of Warrnambool Council and Roads Board. In 1843 he began his association and life in Port Fairy and soon became prominent and influential in almost all aspects of that developing town. 

His interests encompassed mercantile, civic, pastoral, shipping, importing, exporting, immigration, politics and social aspects within the district and colony. He was a major contributor to the building of St John's Anglican Church, Port Fairy. A great grandson was Ian Officer who has Officer Court named in his memory.

He acquired three special surveys with historical importance in Victoria. In south west Victoria that interest being especially the Farnham Survey of 5120 acres between Dennington and Tower Hill/Killarney. This was farmed by immigrant tenant and lessee farmers, some of whom were brought to the Australia at William Rutledge's expense and by whom he was considered a kind and considerate landlord.

His endeavours were not without failures and in 1862 his Port Fairy Company failed with debts of over Â£170,000. This debt was redeemed in full within a year.

According to reported accounts, William Rutledge had a tempestuous manner with an ""explosive"" temper, although he did not hold grudges. This is countered by accounts of his kindness, generosity, honesty and practical, progressive outlook in all his undertakings.

After the failure and closure of his company, William Rutledge moved to his property at Farnham Park near Warrnambool where he concentrated his interest in breeding sheep and horses. Throughout his life his home was reputed to be convivial and hospitable. William Rutledge died at Farnham Park on June 1st, 1876. He married Eliza Kirk in Sydney in 1840 and they had 2 sons and 5 daughters.

His wife, Eliza Rutledge, has a memorial window in the Warrnambool Anglican church inscribed with ""In fond memory of Eliza Rutledge who was born on 12th February AD 1820, who died on 31st August AD 1888, this window is erected as a token of filial affection by her loving children Thomas F Rutledge, Martha Hamilton and Edith McKellar.""

Their son, Thomas Foster Rutledge (1846-1918) was a member of the Shire of Warrnambool Council for many years.

A daughter of William & Eliza Rutledge, Susanna (1847-1932) married Dr. Thomas Falkner Fleetwood (1876-1930) who Warrnambool's Fleetwood Court is named after.

After attending University High School he accompanied his family to Perth where they settled at Subiaco.

Sadlier was working as a commercial traveller when he enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force in May 1915. Posted to the 1st Australian General Hospital, Australian Army Medical Corps, he embarked for Egypt in June and served with the hospital at Heliopolis. In March 1916 he returned to Australia on nursing duties, but on 9 November he re-embarked for active service as an acting sergeant with the 7th Reinforcements for the 51st Battalion. In England he reverted to the rank of private on 11 January 1917, but in February began a course at the school for non-commissioned officers, Tidworth. Crossing to France, he joined the 51st Battalion, 13th Brigade, on 13 May. He was promoted corporal five days later and was commissioned second lieutenant on 14 July and promoted lieutenant on 1 April 1918.

Sadlier won the Victoria Cross for what the official historian, Charles Bean, called 'an extraordinarily bold attack' on German machine-gunners during the 2nd battle of Villers-Bretonneux on 24-25 April 1918. The Germans had re-taken the town in a dawn attack on 24 April. Allied counter-attacks were carried on all day without success but towards evening hurried orders were given for another counter-attack using the 13th Brigade on the south and the 15th Brigade on the north. The 51st and 52nd Battalions were allotted for the 13th Brigade's advance and they set out at 10.10 p.m., in darkness and under enemy artillery fire. Beforehand they had been told to ignore any noise in a wood to their left as British troops were clearing out small enemy parties there. Hardly had the advance begun, however, when several machine-guns opened up on the Western Australians. Most of the company adjoining Sadlier's were killed but Sadlier led his men forward, only to be halted again by machine-guns. He organized a bombing attack and, having located the nearest machine-gun post, led a Lewis-gunner and a bombing party against it. Before the Germans had recovered, the Australians were in among the trees, fighting wildly in the dark. Hurling bombs as they ran, they silenced one machine-gun post and although Sadlier was shot in the thigh they went on to destroy two more. Sadlier was then shot again, this time in the arm, and was forced to the rear but his few remaining men continued the job and the threat to the 13th Brigade's advance was removed. Although running an hour late it got through and linked up with the 15th. By dawn Villers-Bretonneux was again in allied hands.

On 24 October Sadlier was invalided to Australia and his A.I.F. appointment ended on 4 March 1919. On 23 August 1922, at St Mary's Anglican Church, Perth, he married Maude Victoria Moore. Throughout the 1920s he worked as a manufacturer's agent and in 1929 briefly ran his own indent agency. Next year he unsuccessfully contested the State seat of Nedlands as a Nationalist. His marriage ended in divorce in 1934 and on 17 July 1936 he married Alice Edith Smart at the Presbyterian manse, Subiaco. From then until 1949 he was a clerk in the Repatriation Department in Perth. Invalided out of the public service, he moved to Busselton where gardening became his chief interest. Survived by his wife, he died there, childless, on 28 April 1964 and was cremated; for ten years he had suffered from emphysematic bronchitis.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Merrilyn Lincoln,,,,1988.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Sadlier, Clifford William King (1892-1964)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/sadlier-clifford-william-king-8323,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8993277 -36.1394625)

Stan left Korumburra State School at the age of 12 to work as a blacksmith's striker. He subsequently held various casual jobs before being employed in a drapery. He served as a senior cadet (1907-09) and scoutmaster (1910-15).

On 6 March 1915 Savige enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. Posted to the 24th Battalion, he landed at Gallipoli in September. A series of promotions culminated in his being commissioned at Lone Pine on 9 November. In the following month he commanded one of the battalion's rearguard parties during the evacuation. Sent to France in March 1916, he was intelligence officer (from May) at Brigadier General (Sir) John Gellibrand's 6th Brigade headquarters. After taking part in operations at PoziÃ¿Â¨res and Mouquet Farm in July-August, he was promoted captain in September. In November he was wounded at Flers. Next month he was admitted to hospital, suffering from influenza. He returned to his battalion and in February 1917 became adjutant. For his 'consistent good work and devotion to duty' in the fighting at Warlencourt, Grevilliers and Bullecourt (February-May), he was awarded the Military Cross. Volunteering for special service, he was sent to Persia in March 1918 as part of Dunsterforce. He won the Distinguished Service Order for protecting refugees while under fire, and later recorded his experiences in Stalky's Forlorn Hope (Melbourne, 1920). He sailed for Melbourne where his A.I.F. appointment terminated on 24 April 1919. He married Lilian Stockton in 1919. 

Prompted by his own concern for the families of his fallen comrades, he founded Legacy in September 1923. He remained in the Militia throughout the 1920s and 1930s, when in 1938 he was promoted temporary brigadier. He commanded forces in Libya and in Greece in 1941. On 7 January 1942 he was promoted major general and placed in command of the 3rd Division. The division fought in New Guinea, and he visited the front lines. On 10 February 1944 Savige was promoted temporary lieutenant general and given command of I Corps (II Corps from April). This further promotion provoked comment, many believing that his friendship with Blamey had unduly influenced the decision. After leading New Guinea Force in May-October, he commanded II Corps on Bougainville, where the terrain and political imperative to minimize casualties required patience and understanding, but little military inspiration. In September 1945 he accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces at Torokina.

From October 1945 to May 1946 Savige served as co-ordinator of demobilization and dispersal. He transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 6 June. Resuming his business interests, he was a director (1946-51) of the Olympic Tyre & Rubber Co. Ltd and chairman (1950-51) of Moran & Cato Ltd. Two months after the death of his wife, Sir Stanley died of coronary artery disease on 15 May 1954 in his home at Kew. Survived by his daughter, he was buried with Anglican rites and full military honours in Boroondara cemetery.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Australian Dictionary of Biography,,6.0,9.0,2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,The Australian National University,"Savige, Sir Stanley George (1890-1954)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/savige-sir-stanley-george-11617,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.91828 -37.7798785)

In 1864, the school was relocated to a new purpose built brick school house constructed by Schramm on land he purchased in Doncaster Road. Schramm was the head master. In October 1873, Schramm sold the school house and small parcel of land to the Education Department and the German Lutheran School became a State School for Doncaster in January 1875. As a result Schramm resigned as the head teacher but opened a new Lutheran school in November 1876. Thirty two pupils enrolled in the Lutheran school based at Schramm&#39;s own home, a stone cottage on Doncaster Road built in 1874, adjacent to the State school. Schramm was a highly esteemed teacher. His knowledge of Greek and Latin enabled him to conduct specialist tuition for many other students outside Doncaster. Schramm was also the resident Pastor in Doncaster for over thirty years, at the Trinity Church, in Victoria Street. Schramm also founded the Athenaeum and public library in Doncaster, of which he was the president for over thirty years. Schramm died in 1908.

She was educated at Carlton Ladies' College. After matriculating she planned to study medicine in England, as the medical school at the University of Melbourne was not open to women. Meanwhile she enrolled in arts and met Lilian Helen Alexander, who shared her ambition for a medical career. Resolving to press the university to admit female medical students, with the support of six other interested women they wrote to the university council and interviewed every council-member. Largely as a result of their persuasions, council in March 1887 passed by a substantial majority the motion to admit women to medicine.

In 1892 Sexton became the third woman to graduate M.B., B.S. in Melbourne. Penalized by the unwillingness of hospitals to appoint women, especially to honorary positions, the early graduates directed their efforts to establishing 'a hospital of our own'. Helen Sexton was one of the group of medical women who met under the leadership of Dr Constance Stone in September 1896 to found the Queen Victoria Hospital for Women and Children. It began as an out-patient clinic, but when it was officially opened in July 1899 it was a 'small airy hospital with eight beds and a well designed operating theatre'. Sexton was the leader of surgical work until she resigned in 1908, remaining on the honorary consultant staff as a gynaecologist.

In 1899 she became the first woman to hold an honorary position as surgeon in any other Melbourne hospital, with her election by subscribers to the position of honorary gynaecological surgeon at the Women's Hospital. Her ability won her acceptance and respect throughout Melbourne, and her early retirement due to ill health in 1910 prompted numerous expressions of regret and tributes from the medical world.

Sexton's medical career was not yet over. After touring Europe in 1912-14, she offered her services to the Australian authorities on the outbreak of World War I. She was refused, and instead joined several other women in starting a field hospital of twenty-five beds at Auteuil in France. Sexton was given the military rank of majeur in the French Army. She later worked at a hospital in Paris.

Sexton returned to Melbourne in 1917 and settled at Toorak, but in 1919, retiring finally from practice, she resumed her travels and eventually lived in Florence, Italy, where she was said to have done 'wonderful work among the poor'. In later life she suffered from arthritis and paralysis agitans. She died, unmarried, in London on 12 October 1950.

For some years a well-known figure in Melbourne, Sexton was noted for her tailor-made clothes, her 'dumpy hat' and 'flat, sensible shoes'. From her business investments and her medical cases she was said to have made 'a good pile', which enabled her to indulge her love of 'the hoary and the historical', of travel, and of art. In private, as in her career, she was said to be 'terribly serious about ... life and duty, but she had a love of fun as well'. Melbourne Punch commended her bedside manner for its 'kindly brusquerie', and recognized, with some surprise, her 'broad sense of humour'. Above all she was noted for her great charm.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Penny Russell,,,,1988.0,,,,,,,,,,,Australian Dictionary of Biography,"Sexton, Hannah Mary Helen (1862-1950)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/sexton-hannah-mary-helen-8389,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8917107 -36.1416702)

In 1900 he joined the New Zealand contingent to the South African War, serving as a sergeant in the Border Horse; he was wounded at least once. In 1903 Shout became a sergeant in the Cape Field Artillery.

With his wife and daughter Shout moved to Australia in 1905, settled at Darlington, Sydney, and worked as a carpenter and joiner. He joined the 29th Infantry Regiment (militia) in 1907 and obtained his commission on 16 June 1914. He was well-known in rifle-shooting circles.

On 27 August 1914 Shout joined the Australian Imperial Force and was appointed to the 1st Battalion as a second lieutenant. In Egypt on 1 February 1915 he was promoted lieutenant. The 1st Battalion landed at Gallipoli early on 25 April and suffered terribly-by 30 April it had lost 366 officers and men. Shout was in the thick of the fighting. On 27 April he showed conspicuous courage and ability in leading his men in the close, bushy country under very heavy Turkish fire, frequently exposing himself to locate the enemy. Further, he led a bayonet charge. For his actions he was awarded the Military Cross, and was mentioned in dispatches for his work between 25 April and 5 May. He was wounded on 27 April and again on 11 May. On 29 July he was promoted captain.

The A.I.F. attacked at Lone Pine on 6 August; three days of bitter, savage fighting ensued, during which Shout became one of seven Australians to be awarded the Victoria Cross there. During the morning of 9 August he charged down enemy-held trenches and, using bombs, killed eight Turks and routed others. That afternoon, he and Captain Sasse joined forces to clear a part of 'Sasse's sap' of enemy, Shout again using bombs and Sasse his rifle. Both officers were accompanied by men carrying sandbags which were used to make a barricade at each stage of the advance along the sap. Under heavy fire Shout and Sasse pushed the Turks back and then found a position for the last barricade; the enthusiastic Shout, who was laughing and cheering the men on, lit three bombs at once as a prelude to the final dash. The third burst in his hand, blowing it away and shattering one side of his face and body. Despite shocking injuries, he remained cheerful during his evacuation to the rear. He died on a hospital ship two days later and was buried at sea. His V.C. was gazetted on 15 October.

For his wife Rose Alice, Shout's death was made the more traumatic by army clerical errors. She was first informed he had died, then that he was wounded and returning to Australia, then, finally, that he had died of wounds. In August 1916 the Returned Soldiers' Association launched a fund-raising appeal to purchase a home for her and her 11-year-old daughter; housing assistance was also offered by the New South Wales government.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Matthew Higgins,,,,1988.0,,,,,,,,,,,Australian Dictionary of Biography,"Shout, Alfred John (1881-1915)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/shout-alfred-john-8424,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.8908077 -36.1397373)

Born Jan Juc, Enlisted Geelong West. Named on honour board at the Torquay Improvement Association.
Victor had previously applied to the AIF to enlist but was rejected on medical grounds - a hernia. His second application as a 19yr old on 11 Aug 1915 at Geelong was more successful. He was attached to the 22nd Battalion, 8th Reinforcements to train firstly at Geelong then at Broadmeadows. He embarked with his unit from Melbourne aboard HMAT Afric on 5 Jan 1916. On arrival in Egypt (23/2/1916) Victor was transferred to the 57th Battalion. Two weeks after arriving at Tel-el-Keber Victor was admitted to hospital with Syncope, Hernia & later developing Pneumonia. He reported back to his unit in Apr which embarked from Alexandria for France arriving on 30 June. He joined the battalion in the field 3 weeks later at the time it was involved in the campaign of the Fromelles sector. Shortly after arriving he was admitted to hospital again with tonsillitis followed by the mumps.
Victor was promoted to Lance Corporal in Aug. In Sept he re-joined his unit in the field. By this time they were in the Ypres sector in Belgium. Victor was awarded the BAR to the Military Medal for his ""conspicuous gallantry & devotion to duty during the attack on Peronne on 2 Sept 1918.
Victor then participated in the battle of Polygon Wood on 26 Sept. A couple of days later he went to the UK on furlough for three weeks. With the collapse of Russia in Oct 1917, a major German offensive on the Western Front was expected in early 1918. This came in late March & the 5th Division moved to defend the sector around Corbie; the 58th Battalion was the 15th Brigade's reserve during its now legendary counter-attack at Villers-Bretonneux on 25 Apr. For his actions on this day Victor was recommended to be awarded Military Medal ""On the morning of 25 Apr 1918 near Villers-Bretonneux, East of Amiens the battalion had moved into the reserve line. An attack was expected at any moment on the front line & the whole line was subjected to heavy bombardments. There was no telephonic communication with the front line and the lines from Reserve Trench to Battalion Headquarters were repeatedly cut. Lance Corporal Smith again & again restored communication under very heavy fire. On the morning of the 27th the Battalion moved to the front line.
Shortly afterwards the enemy put down a heavy barrage & the lines were cut to pieces. Lance Corporal Smith ran an entirely new line & again restored communication. It was mainly owing to the efforts of this man that information was got back in time to enable the artillery to do great execution among advancing Germans, breaking up the threatened attack."" J.T. Hobbs, Major-General, Commanding 5th Australian Division.
When the Allies launched their own offensive around Amiens on 8 Aug, the 58th Battalion was amongst the units in action, although its role in the subsequent advance was limited. The battalion was involved in the fighting to secure Peronne at the beginning of Sept & entered its last major battle of the war on 29 Sept 1918. This operation was mounted by the 5th & 3rd Australian Divisions, in co-operation with American forces, to break through the formidable German defences along the St Quentin Canal.

In the 1920s the family moved to Grass Patch, near Esperance, where Tom was educated at a local school.  After working in a gold mine at Norseman he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 9 April 1941 and joined the 2/43rd Australian Infantry Battalion.  Of dark complexion and 5 ft 7 ins (170 cm) tall, he embarked for the Middle East on 9 September.  On 17 July 1942, during the battle for Ruin Ridge at El Alamein, Egypt, he was wounded in the thigh; he returned to Australia in February the following year.  In August 'Starcey' was posted to New Guinea and served in the campaign against the Japanese, at Lae and Finschhafen (Finschaven).  He was promoted to acting corporal in December, although later he relinquished the rank voluntarily.  In January 1944 he returned to Australia.
From May to December 1945 the 2/43rd Battalion participated in the Australian invasion of Japanese-occupied Labuan and British North Borneo.  On 27-28 June it attacked the town of Beaufort.  Approaching a thickly wooded spur, Starcevich's company encountered the enemy at a position where movement off the single track was difficult and hazardous.  The leading platoon found the enemy well dug in and, as the Japanese in the first post opened fire, Starcevich moved through the forward scouts firing his Bren-gun from the hip and silencing the post.  Fired upon immediately by a second light machine-gun emplacement, he coolly changed his magazine, advanced upon this post and, standing in full view of the gunners, destroyed it.  Encountering a third post, he and a fellow soldier moved forward and kept the post quiet with a hail of fire.  For this outstanding display of gallantry he was awarded the Victoria Cross in November.  After the war the people of Beaufort erected a memorial to Starcevich and named the jungle track 'VC Road'.

Returning to Australia in January 1946, Starcevich was discharged from the AIF on 12 February.  He took work as a car salesman in Perth.  On 10 December 1947 at the district registrar's office he married Kathleen Betty Warr, nÃ¿Â©e Hardy, a divorcee.  The couple lived at Subiaco until 1951, when they moved to a two-thousand acre (809-ha) war service property near Carnamah and farmed wheat and sheep.  Divorced in 1969, Starcevich returned to Grass Patch in 1981 and took up a one-hundred acre (40.5-ha) farmlet, where he lived in a small shack.  A modest and serious man with a liking for music, he was described as 'a good mate, with a quiet smile and dry sense of humour', who enjoyed sharing a few beers with old comrades.  Survived by his two sons and one daughter he died on 17 November 1989 at Esperance and was buried with full military honours in the local cemetery.  His portrait by George Browning is held by the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.  A bronze statue of him was unveiled at Grass Patch on 28 June 1995.

Educated at Zeehan State School, he became a farm labourer at Tyenna. On 12 September 1907, giving his age as 21, he married with Methodist forms Elsie May Pearce; they were to have two daughters and a son.
Enlisting as a private in the Australian Imperial Force in March 1916, Statton was posted to the 40th Battalion and reached France in November. A temporary sergeant from January 1917, he was confirmed in rank in April. During the battle of Messines, Belgium, on 7-9 June he conducted carrying parties to the front line under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire; he was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Wounded in October in the 3rd battle of Ypres, he was gassed at Villers-Bretonneux, France, on 10 June 1918.
Early on 12 August the 40th Battalion was assigned an objective south of the Proyart-Chuignes road, requiring an advance of some 1280 m. After covering about 800 m, the battalion was halted by an intense artillery barrage. 'A' Company managed to reach Proyart village and with the aid of Statton's Lewis-gun achieved its objective; the rest of the battalion was then able to follow. At dusk the advance of the supporting 37th Battalion was held up by fierce machine-gun fire. Assisting the 37th's progress with two Lewis-guns, Statton saw the attack fail. He took three men with him and got to within 73 m of the first enemy strong-point. Revolver in hand, he then led his men across open ground into the German trench. They destroyed two machine-guns and Statton killed the crews. His party dashed towards the next two gun-posts whose crews fled, only to be killed by the two Lewis-guns which Statton had earlier sited. With one member of his party dead and another wounded, Statton and the third man crawled back to their lines and the 37th moved forward. That night Statton went out and brought in the wounded man and the body of the other. For his valour he was awarded the Victoria Cross.
On 26 November 1919 Statton received a hero's reception in Hobart. He was less certain, however, of a welcome from his wife who had warned the 'strapping, handsome soldier' that if he went off to war she would leave him when he returned. She kept her word and he divorced her on 1 October 1920. After demobilisation, Statton found work in a sawmill and then became a farmer at Fitzgerald. On 21 December 1925 at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart, he married a divorcee Eliza Grace Hudson, nee Parker (d.1945); on 16 December 1947 in Hobart he married with Baptist forms Monica Enid Effie Kingston, a teacher. They lived at Ouse where Statton worked as a commercial agent. In the 1950s he was employed by Australian Newsprint Mills.
Survived by his wife and son, Statton died in Hobart of stomach cancer on 5 December 1959 and was cremated with full military honours.

He was a prominent member of the Barwon Rowing Club and Geelong Swimming Club. Charles had prior military experience with the Geelong College cadets and two years in the Cavalry with the 29th Light Horse. On enlistment he was attached to the 4th Light Horse Regiment, A Squadron at the rank of Sergeant at Broadmeadows training depot. He embarked from Melbourne aboard HMAT Wiltshire on 19 October 1914 arriving in Egypt on 10 December 1914. HMAT Wiltshire was one of the ships of the First Contingent to carry Australian and New Zealand forces to Europe. The troops were moved as a convoy due to reports of German armed cruisers lurking along the transport routes. The troopships sailed unprotected to Albany and from there moved out in one large convoy across the Indian Ocean on 19 October 1914. The light cruisers HMAS Sydney and Melbourne formed part of the armed escort. The convoy travelled under a cloak of darkness with just a hooded stern light and no radio. The voyage of the First Contingent was not without incident. HMAS Sydney left the convoy and headed towards the Cocos Islands to investigate news of the enemy close by. They engaged in battle resulting in the destruction of the SMS Emden. The light horse were considered unsuitable for the initial operations at Gallipoli, and were subsequently deployed without their horses to reinforce the infantry. The 4th Light Horse Regiment landed on 22 and 24 May and its squadrons were initially scattered to reinforce the infantry battalions already ashore. Sergeant
Storrer with his Regiment saw service at Gallipoli defending the precarious ANZAC position, most frequently around Ryrie's Post, but its squadrons were involved in several minor attacks. Neil Smith confirmed this in his book, Men of Beersheba: 'On 1st June 1915 C Squadron was attached to the 4th Battalion and four days later supported an attack on German Officer's Trench at which time the Regiment incurred further battle casualties. These included Pte William McGregor from Mitiamo and Pte Arthur Paulet from Traralgon who were both killed in action and Sergeant Murray Storrer, a 20 year old wool clerk from Geelong, who died of wounds. On this occasion the Turks poured shrapnel into the trenches for over three hours from 5.00 am. McGregor was observing at the time while sitting on the side of a dugout when a shell came through the bags on the parapet and blew the top of his head off. McGregor had not moved and still held his rifle firmly between his legs.Storrer too was hit in the head and lingered two hours before passing away. Next was Charlie Phillips who was just a few yards away from Storrer and having his breakfast, he too was hit in the stomach with a piece of shrapnel which came out near his spine causing him dreadful pain. Phillips gave up his struggle for life almost two weeks later' Charles died at Gaba Tepe, Gallipoli from wounds on 5 June 1915.

The entire area around the lane locality had much to do with sugar industries, such as the &#39;sugar shed&#39; warehouse, which was demolished almost a decade ago, the Poolman Bros. refinery and the Joshua Bros. distillery were three of these. The Victorian Sugar Works was formed in 1855 and by 1857 a refinery or sugar house had been built at Sandridge (Port Melbourne) to provide refined sugar to the Swallow and Ariell biscuit factory.  The sugar works covered 2 acres of land with boundaries at Rouse and Beach Streets. The Sandridge Council used the ashes produced by the sugar works in footpath construction. In 1875 a fire completely destroyed the works.  Sugar refining continued at the Yarraville works after the fire. The Victorian Sugar Company merged with other Australian refineries in 1887 to become the Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR).  CSR diversified its holdings but continued its sugar refining until 2010 when it sold off this part of its business to overseas interests. Former Sugar Works manager Frederick Poolman later set up his own refinery beyond the Lagoon, and various factories sprang up near by. A prominent example was Joshua Bros. (Federal) Distillery, which made brandy, whisky, rum and other strong drink for exporting from the nearby piers. That complex is now redeveloped as residential, and at Rouse and Johnston the old, iron sugar shed was demolished for the same purpose.

Educated at Crystal Brook Public School and Gladstone High School, he joined the National Bank of Australasia at Gladstone in 1913 and was transferred to Broken Hill, New South Wales, and then to Maitland, South Australia.

Sullivan enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force on 27 April 1918 and embarked in July as a general reinforcement. He transferred on 5 October to the artillery, but the war was over before he was allotted to a unit in France. Promoted acting corporal on 23 May 1919, he joined the British North Russia Relief Force five days later and was officially discharged from the A.I.F. on 12 June. The relief force landed at Archangel in June and July, and relieved most of the original 1918 expeditionary force which included nine A.I.F. members. Sullivan was with the 45th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, in L. W. de V. Sadleir-Jackson's brigade which moved 150 miles (241 km) down the Dvina River.

On 10 August the British attacked on the Dvina front in order to demoralize and disorganize the Bolsheviks and so give time for an unhindered evacuation of North Russia. During the attack, which was a complete success with minimal British casualties, Sullivan won the Victoria Cross. His unit was cut off and, while fighting their way back to their lines, an officer and three men fell from a narrow plank into a deep swamp on the Sheika River. Without hesitation and under intense fire, Sullivan jumped into the water and rescued all four, bringing them out singly. The evacuation was completed by late September and the relief force was demobilized in England. Sullivan left for Australia on 1 November without waiting to be decorated by the King. He was presented with the V.C. in Adelaide in April 1920 during the tour of the Prince of Wales who smiled and said to Sullivan: 'Aren't you the man who ran away from father?'

Known as the 'Shy V.C.', Sullivan was a popular personality. At Fairfield, Melbourne, he married Dorothy Frances Veale with Anglican rites on 5 December 1928; they were to have three children, including twins. After the war Sullivan had rejoined the National Bank and in 1929 moved to its Sydney office; in July 1934 he was appointed manager of the Casino branch. He joined the Australian contingent to the coronation of King George VI and took with him the ashes of British V.C. winner Sergeant Arthur Evans who had died in Australia. On 9 April 1937, eleven days after handing over these remains, Sullivan died when he accidentally slipped and struck his head against a kerb in Birdcage Walk near Wellington Barracks, London. After a military funeral, his ashes were returned to Australia and placed in the Northern Suburbs crematorium, Sydney. In 1939 a memorial plaque was erected on the gates of Wellington Barracks, and in 2015 a memorial was unveiled at Crystal Brook.

Prior to the Second World War it was part of the Dutch East Indies and an important oil-producing centre. In early 1942 it was occupied by the Japanese. Three years later, the recapture of Tarakan was to be the first in a series of operations in and around Borneo codenamed OBOE. Tarakan's significance lay in its oil infrastructure and in its airfield, which was to be used to support the other OBOE as part of a general advance towards Java. The operation was entrusted to brigade group based on the 9th Division's 26th Brigade which went ashore on the morning of 1 May. The landing was affected with little real difficulty but initiated a bitter campaign against Tarakan's Japanese defenders who had withdrawn inland. The fighting continued until the end of the war in August, by which time neither the island's airfield or oil facilities had been returned to an operational condition.
The OBOE series of operations were some of the most controversial fought by Australian troops during the war. Many senior Australian officers considered them strategically unsound and felt they contributed little to the defeat of Japan. For sound political and military reasons of its own, however, the United States was reluctant to use Australian troops to re-conquer the Philippines. General Douglas MacArthur, the American theatre commander, was under considerable pressure from the Australian government to employ Australian troops in visible and meaningful roles.
225 Australians were killed as a result of Tarakan campaign. Relative to the number of troops involved, it was the most costly of all the OBOE operations. The entire 7th Division was employed at Balikpapan and it suffered only two more fatal casualties. Over 1,500 of the island's Japanese defenders were also killed.

Born Gisborne. Named on honour boards at Barrabool and South Barwon Shire and the Torquay Improvement Association.
James, an accountant and son of Henry and Susan Tassell, prior owners of 'Tassell's Hotel' in Torquay and member of the TIA; enlisted on 20 July 1915 and attached to the Depot & Clearing hospital reinforcements for the 2nd Australian General Hospital. He had 4 years military experience with Senior Cadets in Geelong.
James embarked from Melbourne aboard HMAT Port Lincoln on 18 October bound for Egypt.
After arriving in Egypt, James spent his time performing battalion drills and route marches. In December he was transferred to 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance, Aerodrome camp just outside Heliopolis. Not long after in February 1916 he found himself sick with meningitis after working with patients with the disease. James re-joined his unit in March working at the base hospital until October when he reported for a trade test in Kantara. After this he was sent to London attached to 68th Australian Squadron Royal Flying Corps. He was to remain there for twelve months. On 1 September James was promoted to corporal and later that month was deployed for operations over the Western Front.
The unit was equipped initially with DH-5 aircraft, was a ""scout"" squadron, the main role of which was to escort larger, slower aircraft, seek out and destroy the enemy's aircraft, and provide support for ground troops. In France, the squadron joined the 13th Army Wing, RFC, at Baizieux and its aircraft were involved in their first engagement on 2 October 1917. The squadron was soon drawn into the ongoing operations that constituted the third battle of Ypres, and was heavily involved in ground attack operations. This role continued during the battle of Cambrai (20 November - 7 December 1917). On the first day of the battle the Squadron losses were considerable.
In December 1917, the Squadron was re-equipped with SE-5 aircraft but its operations throughout the winter of 1917-18 were hampered by bad weather. The squadron was redesignated 2 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps, on 4 January 1918. Early 1918 saw the squadron operate from a succession of airfields under the command of several RAF wings - 10th, 22nd and then 51st. Like much of the Allied air forces, the squadron operated at fever pitch during the German spring offensive to regain the initiative in the air and support the troops on the ground. In March James was appointed action sergeant and June, the squadron played a similar role in support of French forces when the Germans launched their Marne offensive.
The squadron's last major operation of the war was flown on 9 November 1918. After the Armistice, squadron personnel were involved in evaluating captured German aircraft. The squadron relinquished its own aircraft and returned to the United Kingdom in February 1919, in May sailing for Australia aboard the Kaisar-i-Hind.
On 3 June 1919 James was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, gazetted 3 June 1919.",English,,Yes,26.0,8.0,2016.0,Journal,Cheryl Baulch,Centenary of ANZAC,,,,,,83,,,"Our Soldiers, Men and Women from the Torquay area",July,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.3238761 -38.3088423)

Snaking along the ground is a new 80-metre artwork by Gunnai/ Gunditjmarra/ Yorta Yorta/ Wiradjuri man Robert Young, which Collingwood public housing estate residents can enjoy from their tower. The street is the legacy of Antonio ''Dolphin'' Tavares: European welterweight champion boxer on the world stage, but locally he was a beloved Collingwood personality who worked hard to make sure the streets were clean and safe for local kids. Tavares Lane was officially names late last year, around a year after Antonio passed away. ''It's quite an unbelievable feat for an immigrant - a man of colour - to be recognised in that way, and to be immortalised in such a manner,'' said his son, Joshua Tavares. ''I feel like everything about this street is very empowering to a lot of the residents in Collingwood. It has the first non-colonial name. The first name from a person of colour. The first name of someone from public housing. The first name of someone with African heritage.'' Antonio was born in the African island nation of Cape Verde, moved to Australia in the 80s and settled in Yarra in the 90s. In 2008 he set up and self-funded the Collingwood Housing Estate Residents Gym. He was an advocate for the young people from the Collingwood and Richmond public housing estates, explained Joshua, who also lives in Collingwood. ''When you feel like you're not accepted by the greater community, you physically make yourself smaller. My dad would tell these kids to stand up and show others that they're important. He would help them actually feel important.'' After chatting with the Collingwood public housing community, Joshua jumped up at someone's idea to literally brighten up the community by painting the street. So, with a willing artist and full support from Yarra Council, he and Robert made it happen. ''The community decided it was important that the first street named for a person of colour, be [painted for] the first people of colour,'' he said. ''To have that street named after my father - for me to know that my dad, even after his death, is able to influence and inspire people to think, 'I can do stuff; I can be recognised for who I am' - it's very humbling,'' said Joshua. ''And now with this artwork, it celebrates all of us. It's power.'' ''As a non-anglo Australia, it makes me feel very accepted: this is my home. We feel safe within the bounds of the City of Yarra,'' Joshua said. ''I feel proud to be my dad's son. I feel proud to be a child of Collingwood. And I know my dad would feel very proud to be part of this history.''

Born Corio. Named on honour board at the Torquay Improvement Association.
Arthur, son of Harry Taylor, prominent member of the Torquay community and Torquay Improvement Association, was one of the first men from the Surf Coast Shire to enlist on 17 August 1914. He was attached to the 5th Battalion Infantry AIF 'D' Company embarking from Melbourne aboard HMAT Orvieto on 21 October 1914. After a brief stop in Albany, Western Australia, the battalion proceeded to Egypt, arriving on 2 December.
After some further training Arthur and the 5th Battalion embarked to join M.E.F. (Gallipoli Campaign) from Alexandria on 5 April 1915 aboard SS Novian. It later took part in the ANZAC landing on 25 April 1915, as part of the second wave. Ten days after the landing the 2nd Brigade was transferred from ANZAC to Cape Helles to help in the attack on the village of Krithia. The attack captured little ground but cost the brigade almost a third of its strength. The Victorian battalions forming the 2nd Brigade returned to ANZAC to help defend the beachhead, and in August the 2nd Brigade fought at the battle of Lone Pine. In October Arthur was sent to hospital at Lemnos with 'gastric' and influenza, a few weeks later he was  transferred to Mudros.
Albert re-joined his unit on 7 January 1916 at Tel-el-Kebir and was promoted to Lance Corporal.
Subsequently he was attached to the new Imperial Camel Corps (ICC) at Abbascus at the end of January.
The Camel Corps role was to deal with the revolt of pro-Turkish Senussi tribesmen in Egypt's Western Desert.
Arthur endured many long patrols and brief skirmishes with the Senussi. British commanders were impressed by the fighting qualities of the ICC and transferred them to the Sinai desert later in the year to deal with the Turkish army. Arthur was promoted to Corporal as the ICC fought alongside Australian light horse units at Romani. They were also together in the battles at Magdhaba and Rafa.
Advancing through Palestine the Camel Corps played an integral role. It suffered particularly heavily during the Second Battle of Gaza on 19 April 1917, when Albert was wounded in action with a gunshot wound to his right hand and consequently admitted to hospital. He had his right hand little finger removed. It was October before he was discharged. With weakness now in his hand he was assigned light duties. After the medical board hearing and reorganisation of the Camel Corps in December Arthur was transferred to the Light Horse in July 1918. He embarked from Suez on 13 October for his journey home.
Once home Arthur returned to Geelong to live working as a carpenter. He married Alice Jenkins in 1922 and they moved to Bendigo where Arthur was working as an inspector of public works. A further move to Malvern where he worked as a draughtsman, then architect. Arthur enlisted in WW2 in 1941 and was discharged in 1944. Arthur died in 1958 at Heidelberg.",English,,Yes,3.0,11.0,2016.0,Journal,Cheryl Baulch,Centenary of ANZAC,,,,,,83,,,"Our Soldiers, Men and Women from the Torquay area",July,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.3211965 -38.3082582)

Hugo was educated at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, where he an excellent athlete. Hugo and brother Ric worked in cattle stations in the north, and both joined the 10th Light Horse Regiment in October 1914. He was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant and remained in Egypt when the 10th was sent to Gallipoli in May 1915. He landed on Gallipoli on 4 August,and was in command at the Battle of the Nek, where he lost 9 officers and 73 men. A few weeks later, he fought at Hill 60, as part of the effort to widen the strip of foreshore between the two bridgeheads at Anzac and Suvla by capturing the hills near Anafarta. At 1 a.m. on 29 August the men advanced to take a long trench, held by Turkish troops on the summit. Throssell killed five Turks while his men constructed a barricade across their part of the trench. When a fierce bomb fight began, Throssell and his soldiers held their bombs on short fuse until the last possible moment before hurling them at the enemy on the other side of the barricade. Throughout the remainder of the night both sides threw more than 3000 bombs. Towards dawn the Turks made three rushes at the Australian trench, but were stopped by showers of bombs and heavy rifle-fire. Throssell, who at one stage was in sole command, was wounded twice. His face covered in blood from bomb splinters in his forehead, he repeatedly yelled encouragement to his men. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. 
Evacuated to hospital in England, Throssell was promoted captain and joined his regiment in Egypt. He was wounded in April 1917 at the 2nd battle of Gaza where his brother Ric was killed. When Ric disappeared, Hugo crawled across the battlefield under enemy fire, searching in vain for his brother among the dead and dying, and whistling for him with the same signal as they had used when boys. Hugo returned to his regiment for the final offensives in Palestine and led the 10th Light Horse guard of honour at the fall of Jerusalem.
On 28 January 1919 in the Collins Street registry office, Melbourne, Throssell married the Australian author Katharine Susannah Prichard. They settled on a  mixed farm near Perth. When Katharine became a foundation member of the Communist Party of Australia in 1920, Hugo joined her as a speaker supporting unemployed and striking workers. He claimed that the war had made him a socialist and a pacifist. The combination of her award-winning novels and Communism, and his Victoria Cross, brought them fame and notoriety. Hugo acted as soldiers' representative on the Returned Soldiers' Land Settlement Board, became a real estate agent and worked temporarily in the Department of Agriculture in Western Australia.
Hard times came in the Depression. Katharine believed that her political activities lost Hugo his job with the settlement board, and that his passion to own land led him to borrow recklessly from the banks. He joined the search for gold at Larkinville in the early 1930s. When that proved unsuccessful, he devised a scheme which he hoped would prove a money-spinner. While Katharine was on a six-month visit to Russia, he organized a rodeo on his Greenmount property on a Sunday, not knowing that it was illegal to charge entry fees on the sabbath. The only money Hugo raised from the 2000 people who attended was a meagre silver collection for charity. The episode plunged him further into debt and shattered his optimism.
Imagining that he could better provide for his wife and 11-year-old son if he left them a war service pension, he shot himself on 19 November 1933 at Greenmount. He was buried with full military honours in the Anglican section of Karrakatta cemetery, Perth.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Suzanne Welborn,,,,1990.0,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian Dictionary of Biography, Australian National University","Throssell, Hugo Vivian Hope (1884-1933)",Australian Dictionary of Biography,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/throssell-hugo-vivian-hope-8806,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (146.897709 -36.1463147)

When the road was reopened following removal of the shop, it was suggested that it be named in recognition of the jeweller, however his family advised Council that they did not want this recognition. Following this advice, no action was taken to name the road, but it gradually became known as Time Lane.  Some years ago, a series of murals were painted on the walls of the lane, three of which incorporated this name.  It has now been decided to recognize the name by formally naming the road Time Lane.

His connection with Jan Juc is mainly through his sister, Annie Maria who married William Richard Gundry of Jan Juc. Once married Annie and Harold's widowed father (Gasper) moved to live with Annie and William at Jun Juc until his death in 1920. Their mother had also come from the area. Gasper was listed as Harold's next of kin on his enlistment papers. On enlistment Harold was assigned to the 3rd Light Horse Brigade Train where he was given the new rank of Driver after 4 weeks of training. Harold was duties were part of the supply section for the brigade. They sailed for Egypt from Melbourne on 2 February 1915 aboard HMAT A51 Chilka. The brigade then went on to serve in Gallipoli. Harold was back in Egypt 20 Nov 1915 to be transferred to the 1st Australian Divisional Train, western Pioneer Force in February 1916 before being posted to the 55th Battalion of the 14th Field Artillery Brigade. They landed in France on 29 June 1916 entering the frontline trenches for the first time on 12 July and fighting their first major battle at Fromelles a week later. The battle was a disaster, resulting in heavy casualties across the division. Although in reserve, the 55th was quickly committed to the attack and eventually played a critical role, forming the rearguard for the 14th Brigade's withdrawal. Despite its grievous losses the 5th Division continued to man the front in the Fromelles sector for a further two months. After a freezing winter manning trenches in the Somme Valley, Harold was admitted to hospital with bronchitis. In in early 1917 the 55th Battalion participated in the advance that followed the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. It was spared the assault but did, however, defend gains made during the second battle of Bullecourt. Later in the year, the AIF's focus of operations switched to the Ypres sector in Belgium. The 55th's major battle here was at Polygon Wood on 26 September. With the collapse of Russia in October 1917, a major German offensive on the Western Front was expected in early 1918. This came in late March and the 5th Division moved to defend the sector around Corbie. The 14th Brigade took up positions to the north of Villers-Bretonneux and held these even when the village fell, threatening their flanks. Once the German offensive had been defeated, the Allies launched their own offensive in August 1918. The 14th Brigade did not play a major role in these operations until late in the month, but Harold had been admitted to hospital with Pyorrhoea and not involved in any further combat because he didn't return to his unit until 18 November as the battalion was preparing their return to Australia. Harold returned on board the 'Burmah'. After returning home back to farming land in the Wimmera he married Coral Bull in 1926. He turned his hand to being a plumber when the family moved to Albert Park after WW2.

By 1998 part of it had become the boundary between Moyne Shire and Warrnambool City. On 4 May 1998, in response to a request from Moyne Shire, Warrnambool Council voted to name the road ""Tower Hill Road"".

Tower Hill was named ""Piton de RÃ©connaissance"" (Reconnaissance Peak) by Nicolas Baudin, who stood his ship ""GÃ©ographe"" offshore on the night of 31 March-1 April 1802. This name appears on charts later prepared by PÃ©ron and Freycinet. On 20 April 1802 Matthew Flinders sailed past in the Investigator and recorded ""Peaked Hill, position uncertain"" on his chart. Major Mitchell called it Mount Hotspur when he saw it from Mount Napier on 10 September 1836. It is uncertain who first gave the name Tower Hill, but it may have been C.J. Tyers, Government Surveyor, and his assistant T.S Townsend, when they made a trigonometrical survey of the country between Melbourne and the Glenelg River in October 1839. Alternatively it could be a rendering of an Aboriginal name for this district, Tararer.

The aboriginal name for Tower Hill was ""Koroitch"".

Background information provided, ""One of the earliest settlers of what is now North Balwyn, John Towt, was born in Devonshire, England and arrived in Victoria in 1841 aboard the ""Plymouth"" as a bounty immigrant, aged 22. He married in Campbellfield in October 1842 and settled in New Street, Brighton where the first eleven of his 15 children were born before moving to Boroondara. In Brighton Mr Towt offered his services as a contractor and builder, then in 1856 purchased the property of 279 acres which fronted Ewart's (Belmore) Road and extended along the western side of Greythorn Road to Doncaster Road. Mr Towt continued his work as a builder but leased out the property in Balwyn. He named the property ""Whitethorn"" and after being called Towt's Road for some time, the road leading to his estate was called Whitethorn Road. This caused confusion with Whitehorse Road so the name was changed again to Greythorn Road as it is today.  His house was named ""Rose Hill"" and despite many alterations, still stands at 51 Kenny Street today. It was constructed about 1868. Mr Towt appears to have remained at the property until his death in 1891 when the land was passed onto his descendants and later subdivided and sold at auction in 20 - 30 acre lots in 1902. John Towt rests in Boroondara General Cemetery with his wife Elizabeth who passed away in 1890. A death notice in the Argus dated November 2nd, 1891 states that John Towt was a colonist of 50 years.""

His father, head teacher at the local school, subsequently took up a selection in the area. Fred obtained his merit certificate and left school to manage the farm; he later worked his own land. He was 5 ft 5Ã¿Â¾ ins (167 cm) tall, an extrovert and a born leader. After volunteer service with the Victorian Mounted Rifles (1900-02) and the Australian Light Horse (1902-11), he joined the 60th Battalion, Australian Military Forces, and was commissioned second lieutenant in 1912. He transferred to the 58th Battalion in 1913.

Appointed to the Australian Imperial Force on 24 August 1914 as a second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, Tubb was promoted lieutenant on 1 February 1915. He reached Gallipoli on 6 July and was gazetted captain on 8 August. On the same day he took over a vital sector of captured trench at Lone Pine, with orders to 'hold it at any cost'. Early on the 9th the Turks launched a furious attack, advancing along a sap which had been barricaded with sandbags. From the parapet, with eight men, Tubb fired at the enemy; two corporals in the trench caught enemy bombs and threw them back or smothered them with greatcoats. Although Tubb was blown from the parapet and the barricade repeatedly wrecked, each time it was rebuilt. He inspired his men, joking and shouting encouragement. A huge explosion blew in the barricade and killed or wounded most of the defenders. Wounded in the arm and scalp, Tubb was left with Corporals A. S. Burton and W. Dunstan; he led them into action, shooting three Turks with his revolver and providing covering fire while the barricade was rebuilt. A bomb burst, killing Burton and temporarily blinding Dunstan. Tubb then obtained additional help, but the Turks did not renew the attack.

Evacuated that evening, Tubb was taken to England to convalesce. For his gallantry at Lone Pine he was awarded the Victoria Cross. An emergency appendicectomy left him with an incision hernia and he was invalided to Australia; he arrived home in April 1916 to a hero's welcome. Having persuaded an A.I.F. medical board that he was fit, he rejoined his battalion in France in December and was promoted major on 17 February 1917. His company had an important role in the Menin Road attack, 3rd battle of Ypres, on 20 September. Before the battle he was troubled by his hernia, yet refused to be evacuated. With dash and courage he led his company to its objective, but was hit by a sniper; while being taken out on a stretcher, he was mortally wounded by shell-fire.

In addition to this, Walkley designed many buildings and residences in the Boroondara area. He designed houses in Hawthorn, including the Ekins Residence at 60 Berkeley Street, the residence of 'Arcoona' on Wellesley Road, and possibly 'Eira' which still stands on Wellesley Road today.

Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller was born on 4 April 1900 at Benalla, Victoria, the youngest of ten children of William Frederick Waller, storekeeper, and his wife Helen, nÃ¿Â©e Duncan. Hec was educated at the Benalla Higher Elementary School and was appointed as a cadet midshipman in the Royal Australian Navy in early 1914. He entered the RAN College, firstly at Geelong, Victoria then Jervis Bay, ACT. Chief Cadet Captain in his final year, he was awarded the King's Gold Medal on graduating in 1917. On 1 January 1918 he was promoted Midshipman. Sent to Britain, Waller was appointed to the battleship HMS Agincourt in the Grand Fleet in April. He transferred to the cruiser HMAS Melbourne in February 1919 and returned to Australia in April. Made Acting Sub Lieutenant in September that year and Lieutenant in March 1921, he went to sea as a watch-keeper and undertook professional courses in Britain before joining the staff of the RANC in March 1923. At the Methodist Church, Lewisham, Sydney, on 7 April that year he married Nancy Bowes.

Waller began training as a signals officer in England in 1924. He topped the advanced course and in May 1926 took charge of the Signals and Wireless-Telegraphy School at Flinders Naval Depot, Westernport, Victoria. In 1928-30 he served with the Royal Navy as signals officer in the destroyer leader HMS Broke. A Lieutenant Commander from 1929, he was posted to the flagship of the Australian Squadron, HMAS Australia, as squadron signals officer in July 1930. He continued to specialise in communications, developing an impressive reputation. Promoted Commander in 1934, he was appointed Executive Officer of the RANC, which had been moved to Flinders Naval Depot.

In 1936-37 Waller spent six months with the British Admiralty's Naval Intelligence Division before taking up an exchange posting as Executive Officer of the repair ship HMS Resource. More importantly, in 1937-39 he commanded the destroyer HMS Brazen. This was a learning experience for Waller, who found - as did many other specialists in their first seagoing command - that he needed to develop his shiphandling skills. In a busy fourteen months which included monitoring the Spanish Civil War, he learned his trade well.

After a short stint at Navy Office, Melbourne, in September 1939 Waller was given command of the destroyer leader HMAS Stuart. In December she and her four consorts arrived in the Mediterranean. Derisively nicknamed the 'Scrap-Iron Flotilla' by German propaganda, the Australian ships rapidly made their mark. Waller gained the respect of both the Commander-In-Chief, Admiral Sir Andrew (Viscount) Cunningham, and the Vice Admiral (destroyers), John (Baron) Tovey. He was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla (incorporating the Australian ships) in May 1940 and promoted Captain on 30 June. For his courage in the Battle of Calabria, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in September. He took part in the Battle of Matapan in March 1941 and assisted the besieged forces at Tobruk. 

He returned to Australia to take command of the HMAS Perth in October. In January 1942 the ship was sent to the American-British-Dutch-Australian area to help defend the Netherlands East Indies. The hastily assembled allied naval forces proved no match for the Japanese, and suffered severe losses in the battle of the Java Sea on 27 February. That night Waller withdrew Perth and her sole remaining consort, USS Houston. The following day Perth and Houston attempted to break out of the archipelago but encountered a Japanese invasion convoy and its escort at the entrance to the Sunda Strait. The allied cruisers destroyed at least four transports and a minesweeper, but both were eventually sunk in the early hours of 1 March 1942.

Waller was listed as missing, presumed killed and was survived by his wife and their two sons. A Collins class submarine, launched in 1997, was named after him.

Educated at Fairleigh Grammar, Bathurst, St Leonards Superior Public School (North Sydney) and Sydney Technical College, Blair worked as a quantity surveyor while pursuing his military interests. A senior cadet in 1911-12, he enlisted in the 18th (North Sydney) Infantry, Australian Military Forces, and was provisionally commissioned in 1913.

On 5 August 1915 Wark was appointed to the Australian Imperial Force and embarked for Egypt with the 30th Battalion in November. A captain from 20 February 1916 and a company commander, he reached the Western Front in June. He was wounded in the battle of Fromelles. On his return to duty in November, he joined the 32nd Battalion. His conduct at Fromelles and in action at Sunray Trench in March 1917 led to his recommendation for the Distinguished Service Order. Though no award was made, he was promoted major on 27 April. In late September and early October, while in command of the front line east of Ypres, his vigorous patrolling and personal reconnaissance kept his sector secure and enabled him to repulse one counter-attack and to thwart another. He won the D.S.O. for this achievement and for his previous courage and devotion to duty. In May 1918 he was mentioned in dispatches.

Experienced and self-reliant, careless of his own safety, yet solicitous for his men, at the age of 24 Wark was given temporary command of the 32nd Battalion in operations against the Hindenburg line that began on 29 September. Often moving ahead of his troops in the face of heavy fire, he secured the help of a passing tank near Bellicourt and attached two hundred leaderless Americans to his command before rushing a battery of 77mm guns which were firing at his rear companies: he captured four guns and ten of their crews. With two non-commissioned officers, he surprised and captured fifty Germans near Magny-la-Fosse. On 1 October he 'dashed forward and silenced machine-guns which were causing heavy casualties'. For his bravery he was awarded the Victoria Cross. His brothers Alexander and Keith also served in the A.I.F.; Keith won the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

On 31 May 1919 at the parish church, Worthing, Sussex, Wark married Phyllis Marquiss Munro and returned to Australia where his A.I.F. appointment was terminated in September. He became a principal of Thompson & Wark, quantity surveyors, a director of several companies, a councillor of the National Roads and Motorists' Association, a committee-member of the Hawkesbury Race Club and a life governor of the Benevolent Society of New South Wales. Divorced in 1922, Wark married Catherine Mary Davis on 10 December 1927 at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Sydney.

In April 1940 he was appointed to the 1st Battalion, A.M.F., and assumed command on 26 July with the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel. While bivouacked at Puckapunyal, Victoria, he died suddenly of coronary heart disease on 13 June 1941. Wark was cremated after a military funeral at which it was said that he 'liked the wind in his face and lived the life of three men'.

Aged 7, he sailed with his parents to Adelaide; the family settled in rural South Australia and Lawrence was sent to Snowtown Public School. By 1913 he had become an undertaker and on 10 September he married a 23-year-old, Melbourne-born domestic servant, Annie Elizabeth Watson, at her father's home in the Adelaide suburb of Unley; the young couple lived nearby at Parkside and were to have two children.
Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on 3 February 1916, Weathers embarked with the 43rd Battalion in June. After further training on Salisbury Plain, England, in November he was taken with units of the 3rd Division to the Western Front. Sickness confined him to hospital from January to April 1917. On the night of 10 June, during an operation at Messines, Belgium, he was wounded and was away from his battalion until 3 December. Promoted lance-corporal on 21 March 1918, he was gassed on 26 May at Bois L'Abbe in the Villers-Bretonneux sector, France, but rejoined his unit within a month.
After the capture of Mont St Quentin, the duty of clearing a small area criss-crossed with barbed wire entanglements north of Peronne fell to the 43rd Battalion on 2 September. The major objective was Scutari trench. The unit went forward at 5.35 that morning, but was halted by scything fire. From the vanguard Weathers attacked the enemy garrison and killed its leader. Replenishing his stock of bombs, with three others he went back into the fray. Given cover by a comrade's Lewis-gun, Weathers seemed oblivious to danger as he scaled the German parapet and hurled his bombs into the trench below. By 7 a.m. resistance ceased. He took three machine-guns and 180 prisoners back to his lines. His uniform caked in mud, with blood streaming down his face and five days stubble, Weathers looked quite a 'card' to his mates when he returned with souvenired German binoculars and pistols festooning him like a Christmas tree. The strain and the release of nerves showed in his chatter of how he had 'put the wind up' the enemy. He was recommended for the Victoria Cross.
Promoted temporary corporal on 10 September 1918 (his fifth wedding anniversary), Weathers received a short respite from action before moving with his battalion to attack the Hindenburg line between Rosnoy and Bony.

John enlisted as a private in Tasmania's 4th (2nd Imperial Bushmen) Contingent which reached South Africa on 24 April 1901, saw action in the Cape Colony and returned to Tasmania in June 1902. Soon after, he enlisted in the Royal Navy and served for five years as a stoker before joining the Permanent Military Forces. On 23 July 1909 at the archbishop's house, Hobart, he married with Catholic rites Emily Margaret Roland; they were to have six children.
Transferring to the Australian Imperial Force on 6 August 1915, Whittle was given the rank of acting corporal and in October sailed as a reinforcement for the 26th Battalion. By April 1916 he was in France with the 12th Battalion. Wounded in action on 18 June, he was promoted sergeant in October. Early in 1917 he was involved in the fighting during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg line. At dawn on 27 February his battalion attacked the outpost villages of Le Barque and Ligny-Thilloy. On the left flank with Captain J. E. Newland's 'A' Company, Whittle bombed an enemy machine-gun post, forced the Germans to flee and won the Distinguished Conduct Medal.
The 12th Battalion carried out a diversionary attack on the village of Boursies on 9 April 1917; Whittle led his platoon in the initial assault. The Germans resisted fiercely and counter-attacked at 10 p.m. Whittle checked and steadied the forward posts until Newland came forward to organize the defence and regain lost ground. After a four-day spell out of the line, the battalion advanced close to Lagnicourt. At 4 a.m. on 15 April the enemy mounted a surprise counter-attack. 'A' Company was forced from its trenches to a sunken road where Newland and his men made a stand. Whittle saw the Germans bringing up a machine-gun. He 'rushed alone across the fire-swept ground', attacked the enemy with bombs before the weapon could be brought into action, killed the crew and captured the gun. For his heroism at Boursies and Lagnicourt he was awarded the Victoria Cross.
Wounded again during the German offensive of March 1918, and once more in late July, Whittle returned to Australia with other V.C. winners in October 1918 to take part in a planned recruiting drive. Following the Armistice, he was discharged on 15 December and lived in Sydney. He made a desperate plea in 1932: 'I have been trying to struggle on for some time, but the children are badly in need of boots and clothing for the winter, and I cannot get any work'. Within a month he was employed by the Western Assurance Co. On 7 February 1934 he saved a small boy from drowning in an ornamental pool in University Park; though Whittle departed without giving his name, the deed became widely known.
Survived by his wife, three daughters and a son, he died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 2 March 1946 at Glebe and was buried in Rookwood cemetery. Whittle and Newland were the only Australian V.C. winners of World War I to have been permanent servicemen before the war.

Born Geelong, Enlisted Torquay. Named on honour boards at Barrabool and South Barwon Shire.
John grew up in Torquay and on leaving school became a carpenter like his father. He enlisted on 13 May 1916 with some experience in the Military Cadets. After two months training with the 19th Depot Battalion John was transferred to the 2nd Pioneer Battalion for further training at Seymour. Each Division was allocated a Pioneer Battalion. The 2nd Pioneers were the Pioneer Battalion of the 2nd Division.
Pioneer Battalions were essentially light military combat engineers organised like the infantry and located at the very forward edge of the battle area. They were used to develop and enhance protection and mobility for supported troops and to deny it to the enemy. They constructed defensive positions, command posts and dugouts, prepared barbed wire defences and on occasion breached those of the enemy using devices like the Bangalore Torpedo. Their skills and capability were broad from building, construction and maintenance to road and track preparation and maintenance. They could also, and did quite often, fight as infantry.
The 2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked for England from Melbourne aboard HMAT A10 Karoo on 18 September 1916 arriving at Plymouth on 15 November 1916 and a month later they were embarking overseas to France. Within two weeks of arrival John was in hospital with the mumps. He returned to his unit on 11 February 1917. At Lagnicourt on 15 April 1917, the battalion was struck by a powerful German counterattack, which was repelled by the 2nd Division. On 3 May 1917 the Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the Second Battle of Bullecourt, holding the breach thus gained against furious
counterattacks. After this battle John was struck down with Trench Fever and admitted to hospital for three weeks. During the Third Battle of Ypres, the Division fought with great success at Menin Road in September however John was wounded by the mustard gas and evacuated to hospital. He re-joined his unit a month later as his the division was entering into battle at Broodeseinde.
In March 1918 the 2nd Division helped halt the German offensive in the Somme region and fought in the Battle of Hamel in July and the Battle of Amiens in August. In September 1918 it took Mont Saint Quentin by storm in one of the finest feats of fighting of the war. It was reported on 5 October that during operations near Montbrehain, north of St.Quentin John acted as a company runner and carried out his work with great gallantry. During the whole time the attack was underway John carried messages under heavy rifle, machine gun and shell fire. The company sector was a wide one and the posts were scattered. With great skill and determination he kept the posts informed of the progress of the operation by facilitating the receipt and despatch of messages. For his actions across the day John was later awarded the Military Medal. The 2nd Division went on to fight on to the Hindenburg Line and beyond, becoming the last division to be withdrawn.
John returned to Australia on 7 July 1919 and was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the Field on 17 October 1919.",English,,Yes,26.0,5.0,2017.0,Journal,Cheryl Baulch,Centenary of ANZAC,,,,,,83,,,"Our Soldiers, Men and Women from the Torquay area",July,2015.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.3260671 -38.3110817)

Born on 26 February 1903 in India to a military family, he spent most of his childhood in England. In 1921 he was accepted at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich as a gunnery officer. He was commissioned in 1923 as a junior artillery officer. He learned Arabic and took an appointment in British-controlled Sudan as an Acting Captain from 1928-33. He was posted to command of an infantry company as part of a battalion near the Ethiopian border to lead patrols against ivory poachers and slave traders, and to show the flag. He was admonished for his non-conservative talk and seemingly unconventional ways, which he began to moderate as he developed his professional skills. He returned to England in 1933 as a captain, serving in the artillery. He married Lorna Moncrieff Patterson in 1935. In September 1936 he was assigned a staff position of intelligence officer, in an army division due to be sent to British Palestine. He was a vocal supporter of the creation of a Jewish state, and spearheaded the establishment of the Special Night Squads, armed groups of British and Haganah volunteers. While in Britain on leave in 1939 he was removed from his position and transferred back to Britain. 

On the outbreak of the Second World War, he encouraged the army to create a Jewish army in Palestine. He was invited to Ethiopia to help fight against the Italian occupation forces. He was sent to Rangoon, Burma on 27 February 1942, arriving in March, where he was then appointed colonel and put in charge of organising guerrilla units to fight behind Japanese lines. He founded the Chindits, a Burmese guerrilla unit which included Gurkhas. He was promoted to acting major-general on 18 September 1943. He over saw the operation of six brigades in long-range jungle penetration missions. 

On 24 March 1944, Wingate flew to assess the situations in three Chindit-held bases in Burma. On his return, the plan he was flying in crashed into jungle-covered hills in the present-day state of Manipur, India. He and nine others died, and were first buried in a common grave, before being repatriated to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia in 1947, as the plane was American.",,,Yes,,,,Website,Wikipedia,,28.0,8.0,2019.0,,,,,,,,,,,Wikipedia,Orde Wingate,Orde Wingate,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_Wingate,,,,,,,,,,,,,POINT (144.919414 -37.7790803)

He enlisted in the Victorian Imperial Bushmen for the Boer War, and was promoted from Corporal to Squadron Quatermaster-Sergeant. Major Robert Leneham enlisted him in the Burshveldt Carbineers with a commission as a Lieutenant. 

After their defeats in open battle during 1899-1900, the Boer Commandos began a campaign against both British and Commonwealth forces. In response, Lord Kitchener, the British Commander in South Africa, assembled and deployed a number of irregular regiments to combat Boer commando units and protect British interests in the region. Witton was in B squadron with Lieutenant Harry 'Breaker' Harbond Morant, Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, Lieutenant Harry Picton and Lieutenant Peter Handcock. 

Captain Percy Frederic Hunt, a close friend of Lieutenant Morant, died during an attack at the Medingen Mission Station at the beginning of August 1901. When Morant learned of the death, he led his men on a mission to find the Boers from the Mission station. A single commando had been taken prisoner and was executed by the Australians. On 23 August, Morant's patrol killed eight commandos who had been taken prisoner. A group of three armed commandos who had surrended at a fort were taken prisoner, disarmed and shot. A letter signed by 15 members of the Bushveldt Carbineers accused members of Morant's company of war crimes, including the killings of surrendered Boer men and boys, the killings of civilians, and looting. Witton was one of four officers charged by the British Army with murder, and was convicted and sentenced to death along with Morant, Picton and Handcock. Morant, Handcok and Picton were executed on the morning of 27 February 1902.

Witton had strongly protested his sentence, which was commuted by Lord Kitchener to life in prison. He was then released on 11 August 1904 after further protests, alought he was not pardoned. He returned to Australia on 12 November 1904, and wrote an embittered book about the experience. Witton asserted that the men had been made scapegoats by the British authorities in South Africa, made to take the blame for widespread British war crimes against the Boers, with the trial and executions carried out for political reasons, particularly to cover up Kitchener's secret no prisoners policy and to facilitate the Treaty of Vereeniging of 1902. Witton claimed that the alleged crimes were made by disaffected members of the regiment. He did not enlist in World War I.

From 1913 to 1934 he was a farmer in Biggenden, west of Maryborough, Qld. While in Biggenden he was a Justice of the Peace and a director of the Biggenden Cheese factory, and was married to Mary Louise Humphrey until her death in 1931.
